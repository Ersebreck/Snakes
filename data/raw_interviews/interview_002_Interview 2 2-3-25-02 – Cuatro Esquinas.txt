[00:01:35.280] - Speaker 1
How can we prevent it? Well, not by fighting them, not by making them Yes, by fighting them, that is, by confronting them. I leave them. What's more, I don't even kill them, because I have Carlos, I call him Carlito, he sent me the photo: Carlito, I already have this snake, he said to me: No, don't kill it. Yes, okay. So, he tells me: Don't kill it. Yes, because it wasn't beneficial. Because that snake is beneficial for that and for that. Yes, exactly.

And what would you do if you were bitten by a snake?
[00:02:24.280] - Speaker 1
Hold on to the screams, because run to the hospital, I guess.
[00:02:28.720] - Speaker 2
The hospital in Carmen or another hospital?
[00:02:31.130] - Speaker 1
I don't know if here now No. In this case, I would do what you did, call Carlos. Right?
[00:02:43.330] - Speaker 2
Would you trust the hospital, Carmen de Apicalá, with a bite of your story?
[00:02:49.640] - Speaker 1
At the moment I don't think there are any antidotes, or I don't know if they've already brought them, that's what they were working on. Of course, if there is one, yeah, you go for it, right? Okay.
[00:03:00.260] - Speaker 2
And would you trust another hospital near Carmen for a snakebite?
[00:03:08.060] - Speaker 1
Well, usually you have to go to the Espinal. The Espinal, yes. The Espinal, that's where they have the antidotes.
[00:03:14.110] - Speaker 2
And what would you do if a family member was bitten by a snake?
[00:03:20.700] - Speaker 1
The same, the fastest.
[00:03:24.140] - Speaker 2
And where do you feel it is most likely that a snake will bite you? In the countryside, at home?
[00:03:33.800] - Speaker 1
Yes, let's say in the countryside, shall we?
[00:03:35.300] - Speaker 2
In the countryside, yes, of course. Why?
[00:03:38.100] - Speaker 1
Because there is more space.
[00:03:43.170] - Speaker 2
And can you identify six poisonous or venomous snakes?
[00:03:49.850] - Speaker 1
Yes, I've learned a little. I mean, I know what size X is, which was fiercer than around here. I know the coral snake, which is also fierce. What's the other one, the Rau de ají, as they call it here. Those are like the most poisonous, right? Yes, okay.
[00:04:11.250] - Speaker 2
And your friend Carlos, too. He knows how to identify himself, snake.
[00:04:18.890] - Speaker 1
Yes, he's a specialist in that, isn't he?
[00:04:23.110] - Speaker 2
Charlie. Charlie, yes Carlos. Charlie, yes.
[00:04:26.910] - Speaker 1
He is the one who taught us.
[00:04:27.740] - Speaker 2
You have Charlie's number.
[00:04:29.180] - Speaker 1
Yes, exactly. Yes, I take a photo of a snake I don't know and send it to him. Me: Okay, Carlos, I have this snake. Then he tells me: No, don't kill it or this tells me why.
[00:04:38.810] - Speaker 2
Okay, yes, perfect. And are there any challenges or problems preventing Carmen from preventing snakebites?
[00:04:51.160] - Speaker 1
What do you mean? I didn't understand.
[00:04:54.190] - Speaker 2
Do you think there are problems in Carmen de Apicalá? And you, for example, are you taking precautions against snake bites?
[00:05:06.300] - Speaker 1
To prevent? Yes. Well, I don't think so. I mean, people know that you have to leave colleagues alone, not mess with them. That's prevention. Okay, yes.
[00:05:19.000] - Speaker 2
And the last question is: do you know of a case of a snake bite? And others?
[00:05:31.720] - Speaker 1
Well, I found out from the neighbor. Yes, but that's why I'm bringing it to you.
[00:05:36.400] - Speaker 2
Are there others or is Luz Miela the only one?
[00:05:38.650] - Speaker 1
I also heard that Arnulfo's father, who was moved in the cruera, had an operation the first time they did a very long operation. That they have thrown me, yes. Of the rest, no, almost not. I haven't heard of culebras stinging around here.
[00:05:57.750] - Speaker 2
Do you have anything more to say about snakes?
[00:06:01.380] - Speaker 1
No, that's fine.
[00:06:03.360] - Speaker 2
Perfect.
