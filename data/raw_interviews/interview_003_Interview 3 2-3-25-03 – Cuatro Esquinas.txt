I am participating in a study on perceptions of snake bites in the Apicala community, led by the University of Los Andes. And our objective is to conduct a private interview to find out what the community thinks about snake bites and we will not use the data for anything other than to understand and learn about their knowledge. And the interview is private and will have questions about your knowledge of the risks and prevention of snake bites. And we will record the interview as well. And participation is completely voluntary and if you decide to participate, you can withdraw at any time.

[00:02:32.420] - Speaker 2

[00:02:34.690] - Speaker 4
We had a home, but
[00:02:36.600] - Speaker 2
It's over.
[00:02:37.280] - Speaker 4

[00:02:38.030] - Speaker 1
And do you have children?

[00:02:49.150] - Speaker 1
And how many years have you lived in El Carmen?
[00:02:55.590] - Speaker 2
How many years what?
[00:02:57.640] - Speaker 4
Some? Born here, I'm staying here.
[00:02:59.820] - Speaker 1
Born, okay.
[00:03:00.110] - Speaker 2
Yes, all my life.
[00:03:01.790] - Speaker 1
All your life. Okay. Do you think it's likely that you'll be bitten by a snake here in Carmen? It's probable.
[00:03:16.120] - Speaker 2
Really, yes. I think so.
[00:03:18.310] - Speaker 1
Why?
[00:03:20.780] - Speaker 2
Because some cling to others and die.
[00:03:25.550] - Speaker 3
Yes. No, that if he thinks it's likely that here and the woman is on his foot.
[00:03:31.320] - Speaker 2
Well, of course, around here yes, over there they say on the road. There are many who say that they are found at night near the school. Well, Holy Mother! One day I passed by and my sister said: Carmen, the snake didn't bite her because she doesn't even eat there, she was there, lying in wait.
[00:03:48.510] - Speaker 4
Sorry, I want to know, where there are lots of snakes, where one gets bitten by a snake, what happens?
[00:03:58.540] - Speaker 1
Yes, they die.
[00:04:00.760] - Speaker 4
If you don't go to the doctor lightly, you get bitten. So, to avoid the animal biting you, what should you do?
[00:04:10.570] - Speaker 3
Juan, she's going to ask that, on the contrary, she's going to ask them to see what they think.
[00:04:16.560] - Speaker 2
What do we think of snakes? They're the ones over here. Yes. Well, you're scared of them because out here in the country - you find a snake, whether it's in a good mood or a bad mood, you poke it, then you poke it again, it bites you.
[00:04:30.070] - Speaker 4
From one.
[00:04:31.370] - Speaker 2
But we don't know what they look like, if Mr. Braba, his little sister.
[00:04:34.560] - Speaker 4
Yes. It measures up. The size measures the best of one, that if the doctor doesn't lock it in, when it reaches the cullet, it has already died.
[00:04:44.110] - Speaker 2
One question, my love. That stinger, the red one, that's this long, is it poisonous or not?
[00:04:52.180] - Speaker 1
It depends, because it can be false or actual. It depends. If the anchors are whole and the body is a poisonous coral, but if the anchors are not the whole body, they are false.
[00:05:17.560] - Speaker 2
Yes, she is alone, without color.
[00:05:21.660] - Speaker 1
Yes, but talla X are different.
[00:05:23.460] - Speaker 2
Yes, different. You know the X and the size and that thing that goes around here. It's been coming for a while. One day they passed by, yes, it was this big, a snake, it was this thick. And I'm really scared of that one, because they say that one got into people's houses and it slithers around to see if you step on it, to bite you, if it's wild.
[00:05:48.770] - Speaker 4
And when a person is bitten by a snake, who can they blame?
[00:05:56.780] - Speaker 2
What can you do? I'll give it a moment, I'll see the doctor.
[00:06:00.390] - Speaker 1
If you see a snake? It depends, but first you need to stay calm.
[00:06:12.600] - Speaker 2
Yes, relaxed.
[00:06:14.610] - Speaker 1
Yes, and avoid the snake. But you don't need to kill all the snakes, because if the snake isn't poisonous, you don't need to kill the snake. The snake. Yes. Have any of your animals been bitten by a snake? No. No? No. And you haven't? Okay, perfect. And do you know how to prevent a snake bite? No. No. And what would you do if you were bitten by a snake? What would you do? What would you do if you were bitten by a snake?
[00:07:08.600] - Speaker 2
Well, let's start with the doctor.
[00:07:09.660] - Speaker 4
And if you don't make it
[00:07:11.920] - Speaker 2
Well, bite him. What did they do at that moment, when a snake bites him? Was it a comparison?
[00:07:19.940] - Speaker 4
No. We have a Bye! Get out! We have a toy that at the moment we have abandoned. And since it takes an hour there, on foot or by motorbike or by bicycle. A snake may bite you there, and by the time you get there, someone has already died. What can you do when a snake bites you? Nothing.
[00:07:50.510] - Speaker 1
What? I'm sorry, I don't understand.
[00:07:54.270] - Speaker 3
She doesn't understand everything a snake gives her.
[00:07:56.660] - Speaker 2
If you get bitten by a snake, in that moment, what can you do? As long as you get to El Carmen, to the village, to the clinic, whatever.
[00:08:05.170] - Speaker 1
Yes.
[00:08:06.320] - Speaker 2
What can you drink?
[00:08:08.360] - Speaker 1
Yes. It's better to go to the hospital. And it's also better if you can bring a photo of the snake or a description of the snake as well.
[00:08:26.200] - Speaker 2
The snake told him, yes, what comes next.
[00:08:28.760] - Speaker 1
Yes, because the treatments for size X and the corals are different. Yes, that's true. Yes.
[00:08:39.410] - Speaker 4
Because I'm going to tell you the answer to that question. About a year ago, it was that the Amazon was snaring her, there was no stopping her.
[00:08:46.610] - Speaker 2
And the apple.
[00:08:47.670] - Speaker 4
And that was how the snake was. She went to the bathroom at about seven in the evening and it stepped on her and bit her. And I think it was at night, at about seven in the evening. And the son said to her: No, tomorrow we'll take my mum to the hospital. They took her to the hospital but she didn't make it, she died 24 hours later. So, I ask: What do you do when a snake bites you? What do you do?
[00:09:21.990] - Speaker 1
Did she go to a hospital in Carmen? Yes.
[00:09:27.050] - Speaker 4
He didn't make it, she died within 24 hours. Yes.
[00:09:31.370] - Speaker 1
And she was very small. I have more questions, so I'll answer your question. Would you trust Carmen de Apicala's hospital to cure snakebite?
[00:09:45.400] - Speaker 2
That's terrible.
[00:09:47.960] - Speaker 1
It's useless.
[00:09:49.440] - Speaker 2
Touching the gacina is a no-no, it's all for the spine.
[00:09:51.480] - Speaker 4
How come they ask: And what kind of snake was it? I don't know what kind of snake it was, I didn't see it, I didn't see it like the others did. Because according to the medicines, each snake, whether it's a viper or whatever, is a medicine. Not every medicine is good for biting the animal. Because you have to know the name of the snake. And if it doesn't have it, it can die. Because in the village there is no medicine for that. When they take it to go to everything, they die one by one along the way.
[00:10:27.500] - Speaker 3
There are still more to come.
[00:10:31.460] - Speaker 1
Yes. And, okay, also. What would you do if a family member was bitten by a snake?
[00:10:42.560] - Speaker 2
What would you do? Well, they started running, to take him to the doctor, which we can do now? Okay. Yes.
[00:10:49.550] - Speaker 1
And where do you feel it is more likely that a snake will bite you? In the countryside or at home?
[00:10:56.640] - Speaker 2
In the field. What happened? Where did he take the bottles? He's not going to throw away the bottles, please.
[00:11:01.520] - Speaker 4
Bottles that I'm  I've already passed it, I've already considered it, but ...
[00:11:06.240] - Speaker 2
Oh, you beast!
[00:11:07.030] - Speaker 4
Yes, look, they happen before, mama, look. I'm going to let them bury me.
[00:11:13.890] - Speaker 2
Touch each other, go away, let her change it. Mija, a sip. Let her change the beer.
[00:11:18.940] - Speaker 4
Tell me, are you? Or are you working on a postage stamp?
[00:11:24.150] - Speaker 1
Yes?
[00:11:24.330] - Speaker 3
What's that? An interview that brings it up. Interview?
[00:11:28.430] - Speaker 4
Payment only, I can't.
[00:11:31.920] - Speaker 1
Yes? I don't understand. I don't understand. Everything, yes. Okay, if you know how to identify yourself. Do you think there are challenges or problems and preventing snake bites here? In Carmen?
[00:11:53.230] - Speaker 4
Yes.
[00:11:53.720] - Speaker 1
Okay, what are the challenges or the problems?
[00:11:57.190] - Speaker 3
Juan, I don't think he understood.
[00:12:00.280] - Speaker 4
I don't understand a word. She doesn't speak English. Good afternoon. Thank you. Yes? Yes? Is she okay?
[00:12:22.970] - Speaker 2
Well, each light-hearted fan went to the lady's place because I have to give it to her as such.
[00:12:27.980] - Speaker 1
I have two more questions. Just two. Yes. Do you think there are challenges or problems in preventing snake bites in Carmen? Are there challenges to prevention?
[00:12:46.630] - Speaker 2
But sometimes there is, sometimes there isn't.
[00:12:48.850] - Speaker 3
That if there is something to prevent.
[00:12:51.120] - Speaker 2
Yes, because for that you have to take a pill, something.
[00:12:53.880] - Speaker 4
Well, who's translating that? What they're already telling her. No, not her at all.
[00:12:58.240] - Speaker 2
And he's speaking Spanish. Well, they've been doing a study. Study.
[00:13:04.570] - Speaker 1
Yes, okay.
[00:13:05.620] - Speaker 2
Well, the other day the boys came too and it was a laugh. But thank God nothing happened around here, I had a wild animal. They say there are a lot of them at night.
