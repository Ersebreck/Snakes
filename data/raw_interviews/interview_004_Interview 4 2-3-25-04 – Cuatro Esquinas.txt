[00:03:20.020] - Speaker 2
About 17 years.
[00:03:22.630] - Speaker 1
17 years, okay. Do you think it's likely that you'll be bitten by a snake here in Carmen?
[00:03:33.800] - Speaker 2
Well, here you can, because you're always ready to find reptiles on the sidewalk. You try to avoid them, to look, let's say, if you see something like a strange little pile or something, you don't try to grab them with your hand or your foot, but you try to poke around with a broom or something to see what it is. Well, you take precautions, but you always know that out here in the countryside you are willing to get stung. Yes, of course. Death to those little animals.
[00:04:04.780] - Speaker 1
Yes. And have any of your animals been bitten by a snake?
[00:04:13.420] - Speaker 2
No, ma'am. No, no, no, no. No, miss, thank God, no. No, no, no. No, no. No, no.
[00:04:18.230] - Speaker 1
And you said, but do you know how to prevent a snakebite?
[00:04:29.550] - Speaker 2
No, no.
[00:04:31.030] - Speaker 1
No. Okay. And, okay, you don't know any methods to prevent a bite, right? No, I don't. Okay. And what areas does a snake bite in?
[00:04:49.790] - Speaker 2
Well, it's what you hear from people, isn't it? I don't know, you tie yourself up tighter or tie yourself up higher or something so that the poison doesn't run, you tie yourself up. Okay. Yes, you tie yourself up higher and tighter so that the poison doesn't run, right? Like that, the way it bites, the blood runs. So that's what I've heard from the old folks. Yes, I didn't hear anything else like that.
[00:05:22.450] - Speaker 1
And would you trust the hospital, Apicala's Carven, to cure a snakebite?
[00:05:32.350] - Speaker 2
No, miss. No. No, I wouldn't trust it, because there's no equipment there. First of all, there's no equipment, nor is there any way of, let's say, quickly doing something, no, attention, there isn't any.
[00:05:51.030] - Speaker 1
And would you trust another hospital near Carmen de Apicalá for a snakebite?
[00:05:59.880] - Speaker 2
In Giradot, as one is on the safe side, it's better to take one directly to turn two, because maybe there they have all the implements or all the arrests to do what Yes.
[00:06:16.420] - Speaker 1
Okay. What would you do if a family member was bitten by a snake? What would you do?
[00:06:28.530] - Speaker 2
One would try to help it carry it or something like that, because what else can one do, because one doesn't Let's say, one of those animals doesn't even know how to control the poison or anything like that. So, that would be the option. Yes, okay. Yes, right now.
[00:06:45.750] - Speaker 1
And where do you feel it is more likely that a snake will bite you? In the countryside or in the house? Do you understand me? Yes.
[00:06:58.270] - Speaker 2
In the countryside. In the countryside. Yes, on the paths, because let's say, here on the path, imagine, what you see is just grass, scrubland. She manages a lot and more here than us here we have like a little cane, but you know she's And tomorrow they look for heat. So, they look for like
[00:07:23.200] - Speaker 1
And can you identify venomous and nonvenomous snakes?
[00:07:31.450] - Speaker 2
Well, the ones that I know are poisonous, that you see here in this field, are the talla x, right?
[00:07:38.730] - Speaker 1
Yes, they are talla.
[00:07:39.940] - Speaker 2
And well, around here you see some of those What are they called? Vines, those long green ones. But what I know is that those aren't poisonous. And that rotten one too. Well, maybe they say that the thing it catches also makes your skin rot, right? Well, they're not poisonous, but they're still dangerous. And well, around here you see them like the... Well, I've never seen them, but people talk about them, the coral snake, but they are very rarely seen. The one you see most, the one you see most of all is the carving, it's the most dangerous. And well, here in the house once we did come across a raboyají, those little bugs that they say bite and sting at the same time. We came across one here. I was coming out of the bathroom and I saw a snake at least this long. But anyway, it killed itself and nothing happened. And as I'm always... In that sense I'm very cautious, I'm never half-asleep, I eat my prevention, I look at the floor.
[00:08:43.189] - Speaker 2
So, if tonight you have your cell phone and you take your flashlight and shine it where you are going to step or before getting up, because you don't know if they're rolled up in your flip-flops or something, you don't know.
[00:08:58.280] - Speaker 2
So, I'm very cautious. Thank God I haven't been stung or I might get stung by one of those animals.
[00:09:08.350] - Speaker 1
Are there challenges or problems preventing snake bites in El Carmen? Do you think so?
[00:09:19.350] - Speaker 2
No, miss. No?
[00:09:22.350] - Speaker 1
No. And there are also challenges or snake bites in El Carmen.
[00:09:36.350] - Speaker 2
No, miss, not that either. Okay. All done. Well. Thank you very much. You're welcome.
