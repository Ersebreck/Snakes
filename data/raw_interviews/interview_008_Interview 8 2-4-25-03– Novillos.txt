[00:00:35.390] - Speaker 1
I got married here, it's been What? 39 years.
[00:00:41.700] - Speaker 2
39. 39 years old. And do you think it's likely that you'll be bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:48.640] - Speaker 1
Oh my God, don't let it, God, because I Now I've been bitten by a bug a little, but...
[00:00:53.430] - Speaker 2
Really?
[00:00:54.520] - Speaker 1
That hurt, that opened my leg and stuff. So one thing And it even scared me, because you don't know what animal I've been stung on the face. Was it a blackfly?
[00:01:05.630] - Speaker 2
Yes, I have experienced all those reactions and I still do.
[00:01:10.070] - Speaker 1
But that night it did happen, because it did happen I've come this far, and I have all these sores that are so red, it scares me. Yes, of course. But I do, because as I'm poor, I have to cook with firewood. I, at least, have been cooking with firewood for about six years now, I have to because of that mountain. So what scares me are all the bugs. I can see that I'm not capable of killing the bugs, if they get to me too, I won't kill them. When my husband is around, he kills them, but I don't dare to kill them, I'm not afraid. Yes, of course. But me, God, I don't even want them because I'm so scared. It finally hits me. Yes, of course. And here's a chicken from... Well, Spanish, the thing has died, the grandmother of that, of snake.
[00:01:58.460] - Speaker 2
Was the snake poisonous?
[00:02:00.990] - Speaker 1
Yes, one like that, they said. And as the ladies wouldn't let her take it away the next day, the poison supposedly spread throughout her body. And she died. Well. Yes, that's very
[00:02:18.150] - Speaker 2
Yes, a fear, yes. And do you know if any animal of yours has been bitten by a snake?
[00:02:30.180] - Speaker 1
No, thank God, no.
[00:02:33.080] - Speaker 2
And do you know how to prevent a snakebite?
[00:02:39.630] - Speaker 1
I don't know about that, and I don't know either.
[00:02:43.310] - Speaker 2
Do you know how to prevent a snake bite in your house? No, me neither. Okay. And what would you do if you were bitten by a snake? I know what happened, but if Si had another snake bite, what would you do?
[00:03:08.070] - Speaker 1
If one of them bites you, all they do is run off to the hospital, which is the last place you'd want to be and the last place they'd put you.
[00:03:19.060] - Speaker 2
Which hospital?
[00:03:20.310] - Speaker 1
Here, the Carmen hospital.
[00:03:22.830] - Speaker 2
Would you trust the hospital, Carmen de Apicala, for a snake bite?
[00:03:28.480] - Speaker 1
I imagine so. Thank God I saw her as a saint and God and the Holy Virgin and God forbid that any of us here, my children or anyone else, have happened to her. But maybe it was for something. Supposedly, the lady they took the other day and sent her there, went to the end, to Ibagué, where she died.
[00:03:50.300] - Speaker 2
Would you trust other hospitals too? No, me, Ibague, in other places yes, because here they practically let him die, because right now the care is bad, now they have meat. And where do you feel it is more likely that a snake will bite you? In the countryside or at home?
[00:04:13.540] - Speaker 1
It's more likely not in the car, stubble. What else? Stubble, you never know what time the bug will bite you and at what time I always ask her when I go out to get firewood, I ask the Virgin to Yes, that's all. I'm going now. And you look, you take precautions where... Because that's right, stubble, yes, it's more stubble. So, they go to the field.
[00:04:42.580] - Speaker 2
Yes, they go to the countryside. And do you know if they can tell the difference between poisonous snakes and non-venomous snakes?
[00:04:49.820] - Speaker 1
I don't know, really. Some of them they say are poisonous and others they say are abusive. Each one teaches you which one was poisonous and which one is not poisonous. And is it difficult for you to go to the hospital in Carmen?
[00:05:10.350] - Speaker 2
If you get bitten by a snake, is it easy to go to Carmen de a picar at the hospital? Is it easy?
[00:05:22.540] - Speaker 1
It's easier to go once, because you know that in Puerto Rico, if it's serious, they refer you. But it's more difficult to go to Ibagué or Espinal or Girador. Is it difficult? Well, because they refer you, they go by ambulance, so that you don't get blocked if they don't have room to pass.
[00:05:44.570] - Speaker 2
All done, okay? Do you have anything else to say about snakes? What do you mean? I have no more questions.
[00:05:57.980] - Speaker 1
No, that's right. That's it.
[00:06:00.710] - Speaker 2
Is that so? Yes, ma'am. Okay, thank you.
[00:06:02.880] - Speaker 1
What are you going to say to this, let's say, in a case, that this bitch gets involved, what do you do? Do you let her throw herself at me or do you run away or what? Yes. Exactly, the more you get on top of her. But there are times, many times, when she gets to prison, where my wife is, he kills her. But I have to leave her there because I'm not capable of killing her.
[00:06:27.060] - Speaker 2
Is it difficult to kill snakes or is it easy?
[00:06:30.410] - Speaker 1
It's dangerous because there's a little star, everyone shoots. Yes, exactly. Then I don't like it.
[00:06:35.230] - Speaker 2
Yes, exactly.
[00:06:36.230] - Speaker 1
Me too. I ask you, because then thank God, until now. I've seen it, when it's really hot in summer, they go inside.
[00:06:47.520] - Speaker 2
There's more in summer.
[00:06:48.830] - Speaker 1
That's right. Right now it's raining on us. And we burn rubbish and all that. And in fact, there's sulfur that they say the sulfur flows, that the currents go out, that all those sales and all that go out.
[00:07:05.130] - Speaker 2
And the hospitals in Giradur, Espinal and Baguet are also better prepared to treat snake bites than the hospital in Carmen.
[00:07:20.830] - Speaker 1
He's more prepared for that, right?
[00:07:23.210] - Speaker 2
Yes, yes. That's what I wanted to say, because hopefully you don't have a snake bite, but it's better to go to hospitals outside Carmen de Apacada. But thank you very much. That's it. Thank you very much.
[00:07:47.440] - Speaker 1
God damn me, God damn me. Thank you, sir. Okay.
