[00:00:00.280] - Speaker 2
I could die for you, my darling.
[00:00:03.080] - Speaker 1
Okay.
[00:00:06.830] - Speaker 2
What thing?
[00:00:09.900] - Speaker 1
I don't know what you're asking.
[00:00:17.640] - Speaker 2
Is it here?
[00:00:20.950] - Speaker 1
Here.
[00:00:21.970] - Speaker 2
Yes, you've only taken us out.
[00:00:23.480] - Speaker 1
Yes, okay. Thanks, by the way. Okay, how old are you? I'm 39. And you?
[00:00:34.470] - Speaker 2
35.
[00:00:35.990] - Speaker 1
And what do you do for a living?
[00:00:38.500] - Speaker 2
Me, maintenance.
[00:00:42.010] - Speaker 1
And are you married or single?
[00:00:44.690] - Speaker 2
I am not alive.
[00:00:46.790] - Speaker 1
And how many years have you lived in El Carmen? Still. We're from here. And you too? Also. And do you think it's likely that a snake will bite you here?
[00:00:58.870] - Speaker 2
100%. Yes, it's in the area.
[00:01:01.240] - Speaker 1
Yes, yes, yes, yes, exactly. Why?
[00:01:04.340] - Speaker 2
Because this area is one of those. This area is classified as high risk for snakes.
[00:01:16.030] - Speaker 1
Yes. And have any of your animals been bitten by a snake?
[00:01:21.800] - Speaker 2
Yes.
[00:01:24.270] - Speaker 1
What asshole bit him?
[00:01:26.700] - Speaker 2
Natalia, X. That's why we talk about the T, she tells me: She knows the subject.
[00:01:31.860] - Speaker 1
And he died?
[00:01:34.830] - Speaker 2
No, because he knew a specialist snake expert and he helped me a lot. And he spoke to the doctor on the phone, and he ordered the tests to find out what it was and how it should be treated, and as a result his foot was saved and his life too, because it bit him on the foot.
[00:01:59.650] - Speaker 1
And did the doctor go to Carmen or to . . .?
[00:02:02.990] - Speaker 2
From the Carmen, yes, we took him from the Carmen they transferred him, because in the Carmen he was there for more than three hours, and he was dying, then they didn't apply it, but for the pain that's useless. And they took him where? To the spinal, room two for the spinal. And there they gave him the dose. One dose there was the Carmen and the other dose was already two doses plus the spinal, but you know you have a procedure. Every half hour there is an update on the thing to be avoided.
[00:02:37.100] - Speaker 1
And do you know how to prevent snake bites?
[00:02:42.060] - Speaker 2
There are many theories that at the time False, because movies that say you have to do this, that has to, where it stung him higher up to make a turn, that others suck, I don't know what, and that's false, because you can't do anything. The only thing you should do is let it flow, don't get upset, because the moment you get upset your nerves cause the blood to flow more easily to the heart or to the head, to the brain, and it makes you And before a snake molding.
[00:03:19.570] - Speaker 1
What they have to do is avoid, look where they are going to step, where they are going to be, check where they are going to pass and always be alert, because in themselves, they don't attack, they are not dogs, they are not dogs, no, they are in their natural habitat.
[00:03:35.770] - Speaker 2
We are the infiltrators, we are the people who are invading their space. Like a house, when you are at home and someone comes along and kicks things, well, you go out. They are the same, they try to avoid humans or animals, everything, 100%. They only attack their prey. Yes, and it goes up to feed. Yes, exactly.
[00:04:02.380] - Speaker 1
And at home, do you have methods of preventing snake bites inside the house?
[00:04:11.270] - Speaker 2
No, the question is how. What if we have something to prevent it?
[00:04:16.140] - Speaker 1
Yes, exactly. At home, because it's different outside the home.
[00:04:21.130] - Speaker 2
We keep the doors tightly closed when she goes out, clean, always check that the doors They're moving things around. It's to check that the door closes properly. Because for that, that there's the story that you water one thing, that you water another, it doesn't exist. It's to keep everything emptied, everything up. That's the prevention. Not having a place where they can hide.
[00:04:49.700] - Speaker 1
And what would you do if you were bitten by a snake? Go to a Daniel, right?
[00:05:01.150] - Speaker 2
The first thing you have to do is stay calm. Yes, calm.
[00:05:06.250] - Speaker 1
Why Carmen? Calm down, calm down. Calm down, okay. Calm down, okay. Calm down. Yes, calm down, exactly.
[00:05:12.770] - Speaker 2
Calm down, control yourself, but Yeah, yeah. I know it's like being stung by a wasp, like when you apply anything. It's not going to kill you right away, but then you do have, depending on how bad it is, you have 10 minutes, 3 minutes or...
[00:05:28.490] - Speaker 1
Yes.
[00:05:29.350] - Speaker 2
One hour, two hours. Yes. Communicate with the entity, a fire brigade.
[00:05:35.540] - Speaker 1
Keep each hand.
[00:05:36.340] - Speaker 2
The first thing is the fire brigade, because the police can't do anything. The fire brigade now has more knowledge, because they are no longer trained for the area. And then it's always the hospital and transfer.
[00:05:49.670] - Speaker 1
And would you trust the hospital in Carmen for a snake bite?
[00:05:58.450] - Speaker 2
To try. For the first one, a few years ago, yes, because it happened. He had the And there, from the first dose, it went away. Arrangements, training the staff that if they don't have an EPS, that if they don't have a question they are different, that's why there is a medical intelligence, they already do what whatever it is called, whatever it is called, that's why, not because otherwise it's because of the documentation protocol, then it's always the same, the same, the same. If you have money, come on, if you don't have money, they let you die. And that is the reality of hospitals. If you only have solutions, that's it, once VIP, maybe not. But yes, of course, a health post is useful in any case.
[00:06:52.940] - Speaker 1
Yes.
[00:06:53.690] - Speaker 2
Whatever it takes, if not, there wouldn't be a health center anywhere, not in the hospital or anywhere else. But yes, more training for that and having to be more humanitarian, because people think that sitting down and going to fulfill one of their and people who really arrive, very sick, until they do the protocol and everything. I don't think so. They can spend all day there with a headache. And you would be surprised, there have been people dying of appendicitis, something, and that's why there have been so many deaths from root causes too, from negligence, but it's from the staff, not being very well trained.
[00:07:40.590] - Speaker 1
And would you trust other hospitals? And other hospitals abroad, Carmen?
[00:07:47.990] - Speaker 2
They are all good.
[00:07:50.170] - Speaker 1
Are they all the same?
[00:07:51.390] - Speaker 2
They are all good, because it all depends on the service itself. They bring everything, but it is level one, level two, level three. So, these hospitals are like level two or one.
[00:08:03.330] - Speaker 1
In Carmen?
[00:08:04.100] - Speaker 2
Yes, something like that. In other words, they are already looking. But the map, the Melgar, is already another more advanced level. The Espiral and the Perfilardo. Depending on the inhabitants, that's the area of medicine, depending on the population on this side.
[00:08:24.590] - Speaker 1
And do you feel that you are more likely to be bitten by a snake in the country or at home?
[00:08:31.060] - Speaker 2
On both sides.
[00:08:35.600] - Speaker 1
On both sides.
[00:08:37.830] - Speaker 2
You're there and there's no one around. It went into the house and it's in the bathroom, it's in the bed, it's under the wardrobe. Here, daughter, three, four or five snakes are fighting it out. They come out of the child and, precisely, they all go like They both have the mine. That's why you have to keep it that way. If I leave it in the open car, well, they get on my motorbikes, in any area, they're always looking, depending on the weather, they're looking to acclimatize. And the most important thing is the houses, with the coolness, everything. A little bit.
[00:09:15.750] - Speaker 1
And can you tell the difference between a poisonous snake and a non-venomous one?
[00:09:24.760] - Speaker 2
Not yet.
[00:09:27.020] - Speaker 1
I do, I don't. The snake I run from. Yes, I don't know if it's poisonous or not. Yes, because there are theories that in the head, there are theories that in the body, there are theories that in color.
[00:09:39.150] - Speaker 2
But I don't want you to start looking at my teeth. But what's going on? Well, there are a lot of crossings in this area, a lot of snake crossings, and they cross paths with poisonous ones that say no, and yes, because you've looked at them: They're not poisonous because you've disturbed them several times. And when you press its head, they come out at you, watch out, Poisonous. Yes. I was playing with one for a while, I picked it up, I was playing and I felt like pressing its little head and I lost my temper. And it wasn't poisonous, I mean, everything was fine. It looked moist, didn't it? Yes. And when I pressed its head, it took out my screws and I went and left three kilometers up. My joy was gone.
[00:10:24.860] - Speaker 1
And, okay, that's it. Do you know of any cases of snakebite?
[00:10:33.710] - Speaker 2
Yes, of course. And we're talking to you right now. And several cases, because there have been several cases of bites that have resulted in death. When it's your door, that's when you become more sensitive. Ah! Julana. Unfortunately God bless him, protect him and swear by him. But when it's your door, that's when you have to turn around and you know the issue. The rest, I don't think so.
[00:11:00.990] - Speaker 1
Okay, ready. Have you anything else to say about snakes?
[00:11:06.780] - Speaker 2
Well, if your worship has anything, then ask us, because we have all afternoon.
[00:11:13.560] - Speaker 1
Yes, thank you very much. And I believe that in the hospital in Carmen there is no antiofÃ­sico for snake bites. Hopefully you won't have a bad snake bite, but the hospitals in Ibague, Girado, Espinal, are better for a not so bad snake bite.
[00:11:39.120] - Speaker 2
So they are in demand and what they do here is transfer. Yes, the service for which it is transferred. Let's say, nothing more. Yes, but yes, because that day one was applied to him, they applied one to him on the ground. And they didn't have any more, they had like two, three that day. What happens is that they have that, they managed it themselves, not even the battalion had it, the battalion that is constant didn't have it, and they found it in Espinal. Here there was one, in Espinal there were like two, three there too counting it, they analyzed it. Yes.
[00:12:14.920] - Speaker 1
What to analyze. Yes. Thank you very much. To you. For your time. Thank you.
Interview 9 continued 2-4-25-04â€“ Novillos (2 people in this interview)
[00:00:00.210] - Speaker 1
Well, we had the same experience with this one, about the snake. And unfortunately we had to talk to them, until they filled the wall three hours later. That was something But it's something they have to comply with. It's not them, it's the State that issues that protocol. As they say here: Don't open that door, whoever comes can come. I won't open it. And so on 10:00. No, I said to myself: That was the order, wait. Until they give you the other order of who you are, I don't know anyone. That's how it went. Before they got them. And yes, they signed and everything. But now, I don't know here. Here I don't know what. Night, even. That's why I was here. It was getting late.
[00:00:46.450] - Speaker 2
Well, thank you very much. Thank you for your time. Thank you very much.
