And are you married or single?
[00:00:40.020] - Speaker 1
Help.
[00:00:41.300] - Speaker 2
And how many years have you lived in El Carmen?
[00:00:45.290] - Speaker 1
I am a native of this region.
[00:00:48.640] - Speaker 2
Do you think it's likely that you'll be bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:52.960] - Speaker 1
Yes, of course. The thing is that two years ago, right here, in fact just around the corner, I was bitten here in this part.
[00:01:00.090] - Speaker 2
A vein?
[00:01:01.420] - Speaker 1
Well, in the end, they didn't know because they took me to the hospital. So, nobody saw the snake or anything. It was a little thing like this, but nobody saw it. Nobody knew what kind of snake it was. So, they kept me there from eight-fifteen on the night I arrived, on December 22nd of last year. I was there and no, just the other day, at four in the afternoon, they told me: No, as nothing has happened to her, she hasn't presented any problems at all, go home. But nevertheless, my foot did become inflamed. So, she came here and put ice on it, because it always gets inflamed and turns black. So, I arrived and the daughter applied the ice and everything, and the next morning I woke up with my leg all inflamed. Then, the daughters got impatient and said: No, mommy, we're going to turn around today, we're going to the emergency room in Girardó. And there they were very terrified that I wouldn't Why hadn't they referred me straight away?
[00:02:12.909] - Speaker 1
Why did they wait? However, it had been over 24 hours, so the doctor told me: No, as it stands, there's nothing more that can be done.
[00:02:23.650] - Speaker 1
And you didn't suffer any damage, fortunately. But yes, I was hospitalized for five days there in Dubiar. And there they gave me a load of drugs and that was that. I spent the 24th there.
[00:02:39.930] - Speaker 2
Was it probably not poisonous?
[00:02:42.760] - Speaker 1
Yes, surely it was, it wasn't poisonous. But the one that stung me before, if I remember how many years ago, that one stung me on this ankle. No, on this ankle. That one was poisonous. And there, yes, when you see, that's how they gave me the antidote. And I also spent a few days hospitalized there.
[00:03:05.320] - Speaker 2
Did you go to the hospital too?
[00:03:07.000] - Speaker 1
Yes, but not here, in the Carmen hospital, because at that time there was a very qualified doctor called Fran. And he immediately sent for my husband, he was still living with a In fact, the man was living here, with Julio García. They made inquiries in Tolemaida, in Melgar and everywhere, and there in the hospital in Melgar, if she was pregnant, all of them alone, and some of them burst into tears. And at midnight, the doctor told me: "He already told my husband: "Don't worry, you can go home now, the worst is over, she's stable, she's fine, I didn't lose consciousness, I didn't feel anything, no dizziness, nothing. Nothing at all. The doctor arrived and how do you feel?
[00:03:57.560] - Speaker 2
Nothing.
[00:03:59.420] - Speaker 1
Yes. But I really don't remember what year it was. It was a long time ago.
[00:04:03.100] - Speaker 2
Sorry, two brunettes. Not good. You, which one? You answered many of my questions and also, do you know how to identify poisonous or non-venomous snakes?
[00:04:28.590] - Speaker 1
A little. A little. At least I can identify the toche, the coral, the size X, which are the ones that are the most ferocious. And the grujos, yes, half of them, well, they do eat animals. Yes.
[00:04:46.340] - Speaker 2
And you don't have much confidence in the hospital in Carmen for a snake bite?
[00:04:58.080] - Speaker 1
Well, yes. Yes? Well, then, the first time, what I'm saying is that the first time they did attend to me there, but there was a very good doctor, a very good Costarican. The thing is that, as far as we're all concerned, after that doctor there hasn't been a good doctor again. Yes. Not now, now they get there. If the relative doesn't say: No, let's get him out of here now, they let him live, because they don't have anything. We just wait and see, so back then, when she was two years old, they told me: No, let's wait and see and we'll see where the remission goes. And I arrived at four in the afternoon and there was no remission, so they sent me back in the afternoon.
[00:05:45.010] - Speaker 2
And what time did your snake bite happen? At night? At night.
[00:05:53.310] - Speaker 1
And both were at night. The first, at half past seven in the evening and the second, five to eight at night.
[00:06:01.190] - Speaker 2
Was it dark? It is dark, yes. Okay. You didn't see the snake?
[00:06:07.480] - Speaker 1
No, I didn't see it. I felt when the first one, if it was there at all, came from over there from a daughter, it came from over there along the path and my husband was still there. So, I came towards it in the dark. We came with a stick as if to ward it off. When I felt the sting, I said to Javier: I was stung by something. And he said to me: No, take off his boot laces and while he was doing it, I took some grass and wrapped it round it, because that calms the poison in Jesus. And while he was doing that, he took off the laces and tied them for me. And so I walked down there, to a hill they call Loma El Péricó. And while he was asking for help there with the man who is here, who still lived where the foundation was, he took me on the motorbike, he took me to the hospital. So, the one who had a motorbike, that was a blessing.
[00:07:07.320] - Speaker 2
Did you go to the hospital early?
[00:07:09.930] - Speaker 1
Yes, of course. They immediately took me to those fairgrounds and they said: No, it can't be, it can't be. Because in those 15 days I had been treating a man from over there, from that side, from Morteño, Brazil, something like that. But he had been in the hand and it fought hard with him. I didn't know what happened to him, because they ended up sending him to Bogotá. So, of course, he was really scared. And when we got there, he said: And the snake, because then, Javier took the boots of material and high, with the heel he killed it and left it hanging like that on a fork there. So, they asked him for it. Then, with the same one, it was up to Julio to leave it up there, to take it for himself to find out what kind of antidote they should get. But that's for sure, it makes you That foot was black, black, black, black. You didn't let anything touch it because that was horrible.
[00:08:18.879] - Speaker 1
I don't understand how that is, because you feel a burning sensation where they touch it, so you feel like it's a burn. But of course, what I should not have done was let gangrene set in because it was dangerous.
[00:08:35.460] - Speaker 1
But, nevertheless, that's where I draw the line. And do you know of anyone who tries to treat snakebites here?
[00:08:51.410] - Speaker 2
Aren't they doctors or people in the community?
[00:08:55.910] - Speaker 1
No, no. That was in the past, as in In the days when one was growing up, until now, there were people who said that when they bit them, one day they would cut them, they would make the sign of the cross, they would suck them to extract the poison. Others say that they would give them the gall of the goat, that they would keep it in brandy and then, at the moment, they would give it to them. They say that's loving or loving. Those are the home remedies above, not now, nobody does that anymore, nobody goes to the doctor.
[00:09:34.370] - Speaker 2
Exactly. What do you think is the biggest problem with snakebites here? Why is it very dangerous here?
[00:09:55.130] - Speaker 1
No, you see, it's not very common around here.
[00:09:57.850] - Speaker 2
It's not very common. No.
[00:10:00.010] - Speaker 1
Yes, you can see them, yes you can see them, but no It's not that it's here... It's like very...
[00:10:07.650] - Speaker 2
Yes. And do you think it's difficult to prevent a snakebite?
[00:10:14.460] - Speaker 1
How can it be prevented?
[00:10:18.330] - Speaker 2
Yes.
[00:10:19.820] - Speaker 1
Well, just now here, because yes, now in the past few days, about two months ago, one appeared over there in the courtyard, it was always fat. In fact, just now the boy came down, that day we are here at eight in the morning when Elizabeth was looking and the chickens over there in the shade of a dry stick, she was there with her mischief, so she teased it and it went away. Yes, the little chicken was there, curled up under the stick. But as it was already fat, I didn't dare, because if they are like that, I kill them, but I didn't dare that time. When it happened, I said to Elizabeth: No, well we're here and someone has to go and we'll ask them to do us a favor. And it happened, this boy went and killed it. She says: It's a prank, but it's the kind that really hurt. And then, about a month ago, suddenly, a month and a half ago, another one appeared over there.
[00:11:16.338] - Speaker 1
So, as I'm in charge here, I called the lady and she told me that she was coming to spend the 24th, the 31st, but someone didn't come, she came until now, eight days ago, I guess. And in those days So, I told her I was a comforter, then some snakes appeared, she went into the kitchen, you know, you get the creolin.
[00:11:36.860] - Speaker 1
So, that's what we do now. I have a little bottle like that at Paco Criolina and I drip over there, as well as in the more private parts. And yes, no, a little bit, they've started to notice. That the creolin scares them away a lot and that burning the sulfur. When you want to put a little bit of sulfur and burn it, that all helps a lot. So, we've done that. Yes.
[00:12:04.670] - Speaker 2
Okay. Very interesting. Do you have anything else to say about snakes? More knowledge? No. Because I have no more questions. But thank you very much.
[00:12:19.470] - Speaker 1
Madam, with pleasure.
[00:12:20.560] - Speaker 2
Very interesting. Thank you for your time. And you know, the best solution is to go to the hospital, you have a snakebite. It's better to go to the hospital.
[00:12:37.380] - Speaker 1
To go out, yes, to look for the professionals who And that's the thing, it's up to you to take the animal, at least the two-year-old, she took it there. Now when we go to turn everything around, we don't take her, but the children and a grandchild did take her photo, then they took her and presented her there in photo, but no, nobody. And then they asked for her, then they were like students, something, they asked for her to study her and everything, you don't know what happened. The only thing here is when... Doña María has been taking her for many years now that she died from that, right?
[00:13:21.700] - Speaker 2
Yes, zero more.
[00:13:24.080] - Speaker 1
Yes, a lady from over there at Novillo's. But she did go, she arrived And she also got bitten on the foot at night. And let her walk, that we're going to the hospital and that we're not, tomorrow, and that tomorrow. The other day when it went down, it was already all swollen. Of course, the poison spread everywhere, it always lasted a few days, but they sent her to Girardón, and she died. Because of that, they say it was a little thing like that. But one of those little things, that has poison and always I don't know, the man distinguished her as María Cerna. Sure. She lived over there. Yeah, playing truant. And she lasted about 20 days fighting with it. Yeah, more or less. But yeah, already all poisoned, since that's how it was, it had poison. Who knows here, right? Because my foot always lasted all black, swollen there, until not long ago it went down. But suddenly it wasn't poisonous, who knows what it was.
[00:14:35.985] - Speaker 1
Or maybe I was wrong about the bite in the mouth.
[00:14:39.880] - Speaker 2
Yes, ma'am.
[00:14:41.450] - Speaker 1
Yes, ma'am.
[00:14:43.090] - Speaker 2
Thank you very much.
[00:14:44.630] - Speaker 1
Good afternoon, ma'am.
