As the drains flow into the rivers, they come from there and they also come to the school.
[00:00:08.650] - Speaker 2
And not all hospitals have Anticoagulants. Yes, that's also a problem. Yes, that is a problem. There are many problems.
[00:00:20.650] - Speaker 1
And also one of the problems is that also in hospitals, not all of them, let's say, sin by negligence, because this that she gives me, here they have been able to give me the antidote. But the doctor who was there at the time, I don't know what she was thinking or what happened to her, but as they told me in Guirardot, the priority is to save the life of the person, of the human being. They had to administer the antidote and the antidote was there, and they didn't do it. First they charged without doing the work. And what did I do? They took me to the clinic, and when I was in the clinic, we called the guy who had stopped me to find out about the EPS that had happened. He said: No, there's no problem. He sorted it out and at 7:00, I was in Girardot, at 8:00 at night it was already sorted, there was no problem, I was sure it was in force, there was no problem.
[00:01:33.025] - Speaker 1
Insurance would respond. So, the hospital was negligent, because they apply the antidote and then they refer me to the clinic, but they didn't.
[00:01:45.170] - Speaker 2
No problem.
[00:01:48.810] - Speaker 1
Yes, that happened. Wow! For example, someone who is from the countryside, one I know what the first thing is, you don't think about saving the animal, but: It bit me, it almost killed me. And the truth is that you go to the hospital and they don't believe you. First they have to know which snake bit you. And if they don't believe you, and if you don't have the snake with you, then how do you do a role play. And to catch a snake that's been bullied and carry it in a little bag and say to them: Look, doctor, you can't do it.
[00:02:35.560] - Speaker 2
Yes. It's difficult. You need a photo or the snake.
[00:02:41.770] - Speaker 1
And one scared to take a photo of the snake and leave it there.
[00:02:44.570] - Speaker 2
No. Yes, no.
[00:02:47.340] - Speaker 1
One thinks one is going to die, because that's what one thinks. Of course. They say one wasn't afraid of death and it's lies, one was afraid of death. Yes, of course. That's true. And knowing that it kills you. You know that if you let it go on for an hour or two, it kills you. Because supposedly the poison works like that. That's where the heart attack comes from, guys. That's as far as we go. Yes, sir. Tell him that. Terrible. Terrible.
[00:03:26.220] - Speaker 2
Ready, yes.
