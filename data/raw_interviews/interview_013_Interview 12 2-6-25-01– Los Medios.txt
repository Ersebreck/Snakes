[00:00:21.460] - Speaker 1
26, okay. All your life. Do you think it's likely that you'll be bitten by a snake here in Carmen? Yes. Why?
[00:00:32.200] - Speaker 2
Because of the area we are in, a rural area and a sought-after area.
[00:00:36.670] - Speaker 1

Avoiding entering the wooded area.
[00:00:55.050] - Speaker 1
And can you explain more or is that all?
[00:01:01.940] - Speaker 2
Well, in general, try not to let the grass grow too long, avoid suddenly checking up. Let's say we are not exempt from it happening, from someone getting in, but we do try to be aware of
[00:01:19.860] - Speaker 1
Yes. And at home, do you also have methods of prevention or the same thing?
[00:01:27.600] - Speaker 2
No.
[00:01:28.280] - Speaker 1
Right? Okay. And what would you do if you were bitten by a snake?
[00:01:36.030] - Speaker 2
I would think about crying. Yes, of course. Going to the hospital.
[00:01:45.190] - Speaker 1
Okay, yes. Which hospital?
[00:01:47.580] - Speaker 2
The people's.
[00:01:50.620] - Speaker 1
And would you trust the hospital in Carmen for a snake bite?
[00:01:57.150] - Speaker 2
It depends on the type of snake. Because there are different types of snakes. I don't know much about it, but I do have an acquaintance who was bitten by a snake last year and not here. Let's just say she wasn't able to recycle the stress she had to transfer to Girardot.
[00:02:18.540] - Speaker 1
Did you get bitten by a snake or do you know about it?
[00:02:25.520] - Speaker 2
He's a relative.
[00:02:29.920] - Speaker 1
And what happened? Did that happen in the field or in the house?
[00:02:38.320] - Speaker 2
No, that was in the village, let's say in the urban area. She was at home, she was organizing the kitchen, she lifted a vase and under the vase was the snake and it bit her, it bit her on the leg. So she went to the hospital, where they told her it would be best to go to the Girardot Medical Center, which is a bit bigger and so on. I went there and I gave her an injection, I think, a vaccine they give you against that, I don't know. And now she's on her way here. Fortunately, it wasn't a snake.
[00:03:10.150] - Speaker 1
Wasn't the snake poisonous?
[00:03:13.570] - Speaker 2
I don't remember very well, but I know that when it was picked it was poisonous, but it wasn't deadly like that, no.
[00:03:21.800] - Speaker 1
But it bit her. And where do you feel it is more likely that a snake will bite you? In the countryside or in the house?
[00:03:36.020] - Speaker 2
In the countryside, in the rural area.
[00:03:37.860] - Speaker 1
And can you identify poisonous snakes or non-poisonous ones? No. Yes, it's difficult. And do you have any problems? For example, if you have a snakebite, do you have problems going to the hospital or is it easy for you to go to the hospital?
[00:04:08.280] - Speaker 2
It's easy for me, but I think that at that moment, if it's not something very I mean, if I feel like I can't even move, then I'm going to need someone to help me. But if I'm with another person who can support me, yes, we have a means of transportation and so on to get there.
[00:04:26.270] - Speaker 1
And that's it. I have no more questions. And do you have more knowledge or more to say about snakes?
[00:04:43.540] - Speaker 2
No, not really, on a general level. Well, I've seen snakes, suddenly in life one can I travel by road every day, well, on the road you sometimes come across snakes, but they've already been hit by vehicles and so on. Or sometimes I've passed by and seen them, but well...
[00:05:07.180] - Speaker 1
Away. Yes, yes. Well, yes, good. Thank you very much.
[00:05:12.210] - Speaker 2
Well.
[00:05:12.830] - Speaker 1
And yes, I don't know when it's said, but in the hospital, in Carmen, there aren't many antiophysics, antidotes for snakes. Hopefully you won't have a snake milling, but if you do have a milling, it's better to go to Melgar or to Yes, to other hospitals. ... To Guibague or Girardot.
[00:05:47.200] - Speaker 2
Yes. Preferably yes.
[00:05:50.920] - Speaker 1
Yes.
[00:05:52.250] - Speaker 2
But if you speak Spanish well, you speak well.
[00:05:56.480] - Speaker 1
Thank you. Thank you.
