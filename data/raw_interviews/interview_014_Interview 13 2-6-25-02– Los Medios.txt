Imagine, all your life, like the four-year-old.
[00:00:32.730] - Speaker 1
All my life? All my life. All my life, okay. Do you think it's likely that a snake will bite you here?
[00:00:43.170] - Speaker 2
Well yes, because sometimes you see it out there when you see it for them.
[00:00:47.470] - Speaker 1
Yes. And have any of your animals been bitten by a snake? No, ma'am. And do you know how to prevent a snake bite?

No, ma'am.
[00:01:02.510] - Speaker 1
Okay. And why don't you know how to avoid a snake? What do you think?
[00:01:10.710] - Speaker 2
That is, all of a sudden, because nobody explained it to you. No idea, it's better to say. That I just didn't get it.
[00:01:16.400] - Speaker 1
Yes.
[00:01:17.210] - Speaker 2
I'm terrified of those animals.
[00:01:22.190] - Speaker 1
And what would you do if you were bitten by a snake?
[00:01:29.920] - Speaker 2
Well, then who knows what one would do out of fright. Because I'm so afraid of them, I'm even afraid of those toy ones, I don't dare pick them up. And I hope God doesn't punish me for that. And I say that the day one of those creatures kills me, I'll die of fright. I have a lot of affection for those animals, no idea why.
[00:01:51.530] - Speaker 1
And, for example, would you trust the hospital in Carmen for a serious snakebite, to treat a snakebite? No, I didn't want to. No? Okay. Why?
[00:02:05.610] - Speaker 2
I didn't want much. I thought that suddenly to turn everything the other way, except for Carmen.
[00:02:12.830] - Speaker 1
Would you trust another hospital nearby? No, no, no. Which hospital?
[00:02:17.710] - Speaker 2
Well, let's say that as I have personal insurance, I'll get full health coverage, they'll pay me in full. Okay, yes.
[00:02:27.470] - Speaker 1
And where do you feel it? Do you know what is more likely to bite you, a snake in the country or one in the house? Suddenly when one in the country. Okay. Why? Why do you feel that? Because there is more rubbish, more
[00:02:44.030] - Speaker 2
She can in the morning, but not in the morning. At home, as she has a cleaner, maybe not. But nevertheless, sometimes we see her around, don't we?
[00:02:52.250] - Speaker 1
Yes. And can you identify poisonous snakes or non-poisonous ones?
[00:03:01.830] - Speaker 2
For me, all snakes are poisonous. I don't know which truth it was, but for me I'll tell you: It's not even the toy ones, because I don't dare to pick them up.
[00:03:15.150] - Speaker 1
And do you know of any cases of snakebites? No. No. Well, okay. I have no more questions. Do you have any more? And what else is there to say about snakes or your knowledge of snakes? No, not anymore. No? Okay, that's it. Thank you very much. And also, the best option, if you have a snakebite, is to go to the hospital in Melgar or Ibagre or Giladón. Carmen doesn't have antivenom for snakebites. Okay, thank you very much.
