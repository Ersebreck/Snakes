[00:00:32.240] - Speaker 1
The same questions. Do you think it's likely that you'll be bitten by a snake here in Carmen?
[00:00:41.330] - Speaker 2
Yes, of course.
[00:00:42.420] - Speaker 1
Why?
[00:00:43.780] - Speaker 2
The truth is, I was bitten by a snake many years ago, but I was little.
[00:00:50.090] - Speaker 1
Was it poisonous?
[00:00:52.080] - Speaker 2
Yes, they call it a size 28, they call the dance something like that. But she was small, maybe not, and my mom did some things to me there so I wouldn't be the same. But so what? There's a chance she'll bite me, but so we were going to leave it so that I was barely left there by the four of them... I thought it was a spider when it bit me. Then they went to look and no, it was still there. But no, thank God, it didn't get any worse or... I rubbed the poison on as I wrote to myself. They didn't tell anyone.
[00:01:32.800] - Speaker 1
Didn't I put poison on the snake? Poison? Poisonza?
[00:01:39.300] - Speaker 2
They say it's poisonous, but it's not. To be honest, it doesn't affect me.
[00:01:45.190] - Speaker 1
Did you need antidotes at the hospital? No, I didn't. Did you need them? No, okay. She wasn't poisoned, probably?
[00:01:55.350] - Speaker 2
I don't think so, because I was small. I mean I was tiny.
[00:01:59.270] - Speaker 1
Okay. So what happened? Was the bite in the field or in the house?
[00:02:06.700] - Speaker 2
Yes, in the countryside.
[00:02:08.100] - Speaker 1
In the pasture?
[00:02:11.780] - Speaker 2
No, she was in an old pool, there was an abandoned pool. I felt like I was up there and there she was.
[00:02:23.180] - Speaker 1
Do you know how to prevent a snakebite?
[00:02:28.500] - Speaker 2
Well, don't finish it off. Don't push it. Don't push it and treat it like you're looking after the plants, not where it goes, none of that. Like clean. Don't let them get there because then when it rains, they start taking it into the house. Because if in the village and there sometimes they get there and they go in, because it's surrounded by mountains, all that, then when it rains they go to
[00:02:59.800] - Speaker 1
Yes, I know you had a snake bite, but what would you do now if you were bitten by a snake?
[00:03:14.570] - Speaker 2
I'm going to leave for the hospital.
[00:03:16.780] - Speaker 1
Which hospital?
[00:03:18.550] - Speaker 2
Well, here, sometimes they take you here, but they there, according to that, they refer you to someone else. Because as this is like a health center, it's not my hospital. They always refer you to a clinic where they send the antidote.
[00:03:34.520] - Speaker 1
Do you need a driver to go to Giradur or Ibagué or Melgar?
[00:03:41.020] - Speaker 2
Yes, they send that back.
[00:03:42.710] - Speaker 1
You can't just go without it.
[00:03:46.260] - Speaker 2
Of course, you can go to a private clinic, you go straight there, you fill it in there directly at a clinic. And I would say that would be better, wouldn't it? You go there expecting that Right.
[00:04:01.640] - Speaker 1
And would you trust the hospital, Carmen de Apicala, to cure a snake bite?
[00:04:10.200] - Speaker 2
No, not really. Why? For the same reason, suddenly it can be delayed, they do paperwork so that an antidote arrives? So, from here to there there is more of a time lapse, it's quick for the poison Yes. So, they don't give it.
[00:04:32.230] - Speaker 1
And what would you trust in another hospital?
[00:04:37.020] - Speaker 2
A nearby clinic, in Girardó. It's the closest one.
[00:04:44.620] - Speaker 1
And what would you do if a family member was bitten by a snake?
[00:04:53.490] - Speaker 2
Well, the same. The same? I would immediately tear myself away to go somewhere where it really is.
[00:05:02.680] - Speaker 1
And where do you feel it is most likely that a snake will bite you? In the countryside, at home?
[00:05:08.950] - Speaker 2
In the field.
[00:05:10.350] - Speaker 1
Why?
[00:05:11.350] - Speaker 2
Well, for the same reason, because there are more tastes there. And they are from the countryside. Yes. Well, as I say, when it rains, they say that they look for warmth in the house. But then, the same More in the countryside.
[00:05:33.370] - Speaker 1
And can you identify poisonous snakes or non-venomous ones?
[00:05:37.730] - Speaker 2
Well, one or two. Yes, there are some that aren't poisonous, I know them.
[00:05:49.130] - Speaker 1
Do you also know of another case of a snake bite?
[00:05:56.930] - Speaker 2
No, not really. I've heard people talking about it who have bitten it, but
[00:06:01.830] - Speaker 1
Not much.
[00:06:03.230] - Speaker 2
But they say it's complicated.
[00:06:06.160] - Speaker 1
Yes. Do you have anything else to say about snakes? No, no. I have no more questions. No. Thank you very much.
