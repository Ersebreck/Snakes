And how many years have you lived in El Carmen?
[00:00:37.110] - Speaker 1
All my life, all my time, I have lived here, I am from here.
[00:00:40.470] - Speaker 2
And do you think it's likely that you'll be bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:46.760] - Speaker 1
Yes, of course, because anyway, whether in the countryside or in the village, they are going out come rain or shine, there are high mountains, they go out. And there are many possibilities. The thing is that you don't know that these creatures won't bite you, but there is a possibility that you might get bitten and you won't even see it. Because there are a lot of snakes, there are a lot of snakes. What happens is that there are some in places where there aren't any, but there is a possibility that they could bite you and there have been a lot of deaths here, a lot of people killed by snakes. So, you say yes, because you have seen those who have been bitten. I was also bitten by a snake that they won't let me bite because it wasn't convenient for me to be bitten. And inside my bedroom. Before, more like That's why I say that there is a lot of possibility in the calm of apicala that there are snakes devouring us.
[00:01:42.857] - Speaker 1
Or the thing is that there is plenty of room. And where there is plenty of room and song, that is where the snake is produced. But thank God, I've been careful for my age, I've never been bitten, but I did have a lashing from a poisonous flower, which I realized and if not, it would have bitten me.
[00:02:01.050] - Speaker 1
But anyway, thank God, nothing happened. What else could it be?
[00:02:06.230] - Speaker 2
Bye, baby.
[00:02:08.160] - Speaker 1
Bye. What else would it be?
[00:02:12.610] - Speaker 2
And, have any of your animals been bitten by a snake? A cat.
[00:02:19.730] - Speaker 1
A cat. A cat was killed by a snake.
[00:02:22.030] - Speaker 2
And did the cat bite?
[00:02:24.830] - Speaker 1
Yes, it was bitten. We knew it was a cat because it was a snake, because the kitten didn't bury itself or anything, and none of the animals that eat it, until after three days, which is when you know that the snake, when a snake bites, after three days, the animals bite it to eat it. So we knew it was a snake. Yes, that's why we realized.
[00:02:48.050] - Speaker 2
And do you know how to prevent a milling of being confident?
[00:02:53.120] - Speaker 1
No, I really don't know that. There are many cons, but I don't know, let's say, that they know.
[00:03:02.680] - Speaker 2
Okay. I don't know in the country and you don't know in the country and you don't know at home either. Yes. Okay.
[00:03:09.950] - Speaker 1
Yes, she's been let loose in the house and in the countryside No, it was in the house, in the bedroom, that she got me once, when I realized I was surrounded by her. And a big one, because that was an extra-large, the one that was in...
[00:03:24.710] - Speaker 2
At your place.
[00:03:25.800] - Speaker 1
In the bedroom where I slept, in the bed.
[00:03:29.900] - Speaker 2
And what happened? How did you get rid of the snake?
[00:03:37.840] - Speaker 1
I killed her.
[00:03:39.370] - Speaker 2
Okay.
[00:03:40.010] - Speaker 1
So, we called, I went to kill it because Yeah. I killed it because there was no other solution and it couldn't be left alive because it was a wild animal. What do you want, Mom? Sorry. Go on, Mommy. Yesterday's juice. Yesterday's juice. Leave it to me, and I'll turn it over for you right now. Here in the gully? Right there. And thank God I killed it and we took it out, and the next day it was more than a meter long, it was like a ballad, the snake was big. But I lived at the bottom of a ravine. So there was more chance that there would be animals left over. And as they were always cleaning everything, it was going to rain, they were looking for it. The snake, why do you see one bitten in the house, because when it's going to rain they look for houses to shelter from the water, because you don't see the rest like that, someone handles like that in the house.
[00:04:42.993] - Speaker 1
And as these people are attractive, at the foot of the ravines, in the woods, by the trees. There she goes, there she goes. What else would be bad?
[00:04:53.720] - Speaker 2
What would you do if you were bitten by a snake?
[00:04:59.390] - Speaker 1
Well, there. And the only salvation is to get one out quickly to the medical center, because if one doesn't know what to use against what one has, the only salvation is to get one to the medical center. In Carmen? In Carmen de Picalá. Yes, because there they refer one to the centers where they have the antidote for snake bites.
[00:05:21.090] - Speaker 2
Would you trust the hospital in Carmen to cure a woman? No. But
[00:05:27.230] - Speaker 1
At El Carmen it's like, let's say, giving someone first aid, because there's no way They don't keep the drugs there for snake bites. It has to be in another center where yours is a bigger problem.
[00:05:43.000] - Speaker 2
Which other one?
[00:05:45.020] - Speaker 1
There's Girardot, which is with Nino Marca, Espinal, which is already Tónima, and Baguet, which is the capital of us here, that's the hospitals where the specialists are and everything, where they see you more for those bites there.
[00:05:59.840] - Speaker 2
And where do you feel it is more likely that a snake will bite you? In the countryside or at home?
[00:06:09.080] - Speaker 1
All right, mom. All right.
[00:06:10.590] - Speaker 2
And can you identify whether the snake is poisonous or not poisonous?
[00:06:16.010] - Speaker 1
Well, when you know it, I can identify the snake that is dangerous, the one that is poisonous, the one that is not poisonous. Because you already know that one, the fierce one is fierce and the one that's on the move, because there are a lot of snakes that are sluts, that snake, if you don't bother it, it won't throw you or bite you, the rib snake, if they made it a rib snake, or not. You can identify that one, I can identify those bugs when they're fierce, when they're not fierce. Otherwise, no.
[00:06:49.260] - Speaker 2
And do you know of any cases of people who have been killed by snakes? Yes. What happened?
[00:06:58.210] - Speaker 1
The thing is that we heard that about five months ago, six months ago, he got bit here, by what was here. The man had to die. The man didn't get the right kind of drug. The flesh on his foot rotted, everything rotted, he almost lost his leg because there was a snake so poisonous that he almost lost his leg to the snake's bite because the wrong kind of drug was used for that animal's bite. Well, there is a plant and I didn't know it, but he recovered and everything. But he struggled for a long time with his leg, he almost died because of the animal's bite. And that was it.
[00:07:47.330] - Speaker 2
Okay, I have no more questions. Do you have anything else to say about snakes? No. Okay. Thank you very much for your time.
[00:07:58.500] - Speaker 1
And yes, thank you.
