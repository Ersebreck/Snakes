[00:00:15.260] - Speaker 1
And are you married or single? Single. And do you have children? Yes. How many? Four. And how many years have you lived in El Carmen?
[00:00:27.440] - Speaker 2
I'm a native of here, of Colón. Okay. Well, of course, I lived in Bogotá for a while, but I settled here again. I've been living here, in Carmen de Colón, for 23 years.
[00:00:39.090] - Speaker 1
Do you think it's likely that I'll get bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:46.180] - Speaker 2
It could be probable, because we are always exposed in the field. And just a little while ago, for the new year, a carving rolled over there on that piece of furniture. And it was one in the morning, mate, when my son arrived and told his wife to throw the motorbike there, because they always put it there and the helmets over there. When she says: What's that? Well, a carving this big, all curled up there on the piece of furniture. But he had never seen that, only that night I don't know why he saw it.
[00:01:19.160] - Speaker 1
And your mate, your mató?
[00:01:22.710] - Speaker 2
Yes, of course. You killed her. My son killed her.
[00:01:25.930] - Speaker 1
And red cedar, is red cedar poisonous or not? Red cedar?
[00:01:31.080] - Speaker 2
Yes, of course. The size is a problem, yes.
[00:01:32.730] - Speaker 1
It's the same as an X-size.
[00:01:35.570] - Speaker 2
Yes, it's the same size X.
[00:01:38.360] - Speaker 1
I've never heard of the red carving, but I'm size X. And have any of your animals been bitten by a snake?
[00:01:53.030] - Speaker 2
No, sir.
[00:01:54.750] - Speaker 1
And do you know how to prevent a snakebite?
[00:02:00.460] - Speaker 2
Well, no, he's not ready for that.
[00:02:03.930] - Speaker 1
Or to avoid a snake bite?
[00:02:10.860] - Speaker 2
Well, to avoid it, what would I say? Well, to avoid it is to see it in time, so that it doesn't bite you. And well, sometimes you use creolin, things like that to scare it away.
[00:02:25.100] - Speaker 1
And what would you do if you came across a snake?
[00:02:31.780] - Speaker 2
I don't know what I would do, because I am very afraid of them. I am terrified of them, but if I can kill her, I will kill her no matter what. I will find the strength somewhere and I will kill her because I will kill her, I will not let her go.
[00:02:45.920] - Speaker 1
And would you trust the hospital, Carmen de Apicala, to cure a snake bite?
[00:02:53.010] - Speaker 2
No. Why? No, because there isn't There are facilities and first aid and all that, but maybe one shouldn't be admitted there, because there... Well, of course. Because logically, they can't provide that service there, I think.
[00:03:12.240] - Speaker 1
And would you trust the other nearby hospital in Carmen de la Picada?
[00:03:19.430] - Speaker 2
Well, the closest would be Melgaro, Girardón.
[00:03:23.200] - Speaker 1
And what would you do if a family member was bitten by a snake? The same? You don't know.
[00:03:37.230] - Speaker 2
At that moment you don't think about what to do.
[00:03:40.710] - Speaker 1
And where do you feel it is more likely that a snake will bite you? In the countryside or at home?
[00:03:49.330] - Speaker 2
Well, logically all of this is countryside. Anywhere you can be, except for the possibility of being bitten by a snake.
[00:03:56.870] - Speaker 1
And can you identify whether a snake is poisonous or not?
[00:04:02.000] - Speaker 2
Well, to be honest, I think they're all snakes, they'll all be poisonous.
[00:04:08.080] - Speaker 1
I think so, don't I? Not these days.
[00:04:11.430] - Speaker 2
Because they say to you: Don't kill this snake, why that one isn't poisonous. Don't kill it, no, I'll kill it, even if it isn't poisonous, I'll kill it. Because, of course, it's a snake.
[00:04:20.980] - Speaker 1
Yes, no, not all snakes are poisonous. Here in Carmen, the X-rated ones, Corals and Cascabeles are the poisonous ones.
[00:04:36.750] - Speaker 2
All three? The brave ones, yes. And the other one? So, are there four or five?
[00:04:43.580] - Speaker 1
Yes. And if you see a rattlesnake size X or a coral snake, you can kill it. But if you see another one, you can't kill it. You don't need to. Yes. You don't need to. Do you know of a case of a snake biter?
[00:05:11.740] - Speaker 2
Yes, ma'am.
[00:05:13.040] - Speaker 1
What happened?
[00:05:14.730] - Speaker 2
The friend's heifer got stung by a little snake this big and it bit my friend. In this part. It came out in this part of the sting. And she, as she saw that the snake was so tiny, she didn't go to the hospital or to a doctor.
[00:05:32.720] - Speaker 1
Wasn't it poisonous?
[00:05:33.650] - Speaker 2
That was at around eight in the evening and at five in the morning she asked to be taken out of the field for the weather. And not when it had already started to rain. But nevertheless, it lasted for 16 days. But totally After 16 days she died from the bite of that louse.
[00:06:00.730] - Speaker 1
I have no more questions. Do you have anything more to say about snakes?
[00:06:07.840] - Speaker 2
No.
[00:06:08.530] - Speaker 1
Right? Okay.
[00:06:10.190] - Speaker 2
There is one question. In the event of being bitten by a snake, what should I do? In the moment, let's say.
[00:06:17.700] - Speaker 1
You must go to the hospital. Yes, immediately. And the hospitals in Melgar, Jirador, and Bagues are better than the hospital in Carmen de Apicala, because you need antidotes for the poison. And those hospitals have them. You don't need to touch a toniquet or
[00:06:55.150] - Speaker 2
Don't get yourself into anything.
[00:06:56.430] - Speaker 1
No, just the hospital. Okay, thank you very much.
[00:07:03.200] - Speaker 2
Well, yes, ma'am.
