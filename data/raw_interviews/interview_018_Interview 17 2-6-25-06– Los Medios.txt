[00:00:22.860] - Speaker 1
And how many children do you have? Three. And how many years have you lived in El Carmen?
[00:00:31.970] - Speaker 2
Well, I'm from El Carmen, but I had left and returned during the pandemic, just like that.
[00:00:37.980] - Speaker 1
Five years ago. Five years. Yes. Do you think it's likely that you'll be bitten by a snake here? Yes.
[00:00:47.020] - Speaker 2
Why? Yes, because we are in a wooded area, an area with a lot of hills. So yes, probably yes.
[00:00:57.290] - Speaker 1
And has any animal of yours been bitten by a snake?
[00:01:02.350] - Speaker 2
Animal?
[00:01:03.070] - Speaker 1
Yes, your animal. Right? Okay. And do you know how to prevent or avoid snake bites?
[00:01:10.790] - Speaker 2
How can we prevent or avoid it? Well, if you happen to see one, you can avoid disturbing it, because an animal won't attack if you don't bother it. So, by not disturbing it, by leaving it alone. So, in itself, preventing it, after you've stepped on it or something, it's difficult to prevent it from biting you. But if you happen to see it, you can avoid disturbing it. Yes, exactly.
[00:01:33.510] - Speaker 1
And what would you do if you were bitten by a snake?
[00:01:38.090] - Speaker 2
Well, I'd be really scared, I'd faint immediately. Yes, of course. I haven't the faintest idea what my reaction would be in the moment, because that's when you panic, you get scared.
[00:01:51.200] - Speaker 1
Yes, you need to stay calm at first. Yes. And would you trust the hospital, Carmen de Apicala, to cure a death? No.
[00:02:07.340] - Speaker 2
Why? Because, in the first place, they don't have the antidote, or the equipment, or the necessary things that are required in the case. No.
[00:02:18.300] - Speaker 1
No? No. Would you trust the other hospital nearby?
[00:02:22.640] - Speaker 2
Yes, Girardot. Mirgar, yes.
[00:02:27.470] - Speaker 1
And where do you think you are most likely to be killed by a snake? In the fields or in the house?
[00:02:36.300] - Speaker 2
In the countryside. Why do you feel? In the deepest forest, yes. The lora?
[00:02:48.120] - Speaker 1
The lora? What is it?
[00:02:52.150] - Speaker 2
A parrot.
[00:02:54.120] - Speaker 1
Or a bird? A Can you identify poisonous or non-poisonous snakes?
[00:03:06.720] - Speaker 2
Some, but not all.
[00:03:09.770] - Speaker 1
Not all of them. No. Which ones can you identify?
[00:03:12.390] - Speaker 2
Let's say that the X, that the Chorus, a Bell, but no more.
[00:03:19.200] - Speaker 1
Okay, yes. Those are the poisonous ones here. Yes. And do you know of a case of a snake bite?
[00:03:31.000] - Speaker 2
Yes, I joined the mila.
[00:03:32.590] - Speaker 1
What happened? The mila. I went to the mila. That's it, I have no more questions. But in the case of a snakebite, it's better to go to the hospital immediately. Yes, that too. And I think the hospitals in Medgar, Girardot and Baguet are better.
[00:04:04.110] - Speaker 2
Espinal and Baguet. And Espinal too. Girardot, but from there they always take you somewhere else. Yes.
[00:04:11.810] - Speaker 1
Do you have anything more to say about snakes or bites like that? No. No, I'm really scared of them. Of course. Yes. Okay, thank you very much. Very much.
