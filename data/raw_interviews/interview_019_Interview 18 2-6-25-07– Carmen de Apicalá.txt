[00:01:17.320] - Speaker 2
Of course, there are a lot of snakes here.
[00:01:19.460] - Speaker 1

[00:01:26.640] - Speaker 2
One cow, one cow. He killed two animals.
[00:01:30.050] - Speaker 1
Did the cow bite itself?
[00:01:34.370] - Speaker 2
Well, let's say we found her as a kind of style, let's say, let's say, very hurt, she couldn't even walk and And we realized it was because she didn't like pimps. She lasted there for about two or three days without getting inflamed.
[00:01:54.830] - Speaker 1
And do you know how to prevent a snakebite?
[00:02:03.860] - Speaker 2
No, absolutely not.
[00:02:05.240] - Speaker 1
Or avoid it too?
[00:02:08.030] - Speaker 2
Avoid, yes, maybe not. No, because how does one manage to be In any moment one finds it.
[00:02:18.930] - Speaker 1
And what would you do if you were bitten by a snake?
[00:02:25.140] - Speaker 2
At this moment, you should come here for the hospital, the only thing Because there is no
[00:02:31.490] - Speaker 1
The hospital here in Carmen?
[00:02:34.000] - Speaker 2
Yes, Carmen and Carmen.
[00:02:35.740] - Speaker 1
Would you trust the hospital, Carmen de Apicala, to cure a snakebite?
[00:02:41.270] - Speaker 2
Well, there's no such thing here, they don't have that here, there's no But then, suddenly, they refer you elsewhere, because here we don't... Whenever there have been bites here, they always refer you to Girardó.
[00:02:54.750] - Speaker 1
Would you trust other hospitals? Of course, more. Others more of gypsy or gypsy-like?
[00:03:09.110] - Speaker 2
No, around here it's more I don't know any more fashion people like that.
[00:03:14.590] - Speaker 1
And where do you feel it is more likely that a snake will bite you? In the countryside or at home?
[00:03:25.700] - Speaker 2
In the field.
[00:03:26.680] - Speaker 1
Why?
[00:03:28.070] - Speaker 2
Because there are a lot of bushes. We even have a farm over there and every time I go there I always find a snake, but as you are more or less prepared, then
[00:03:44.020] - Speaker 1
Can you identify poisonous snakes or non-poisonous ones?
[00:03:49.220] - Speaker 2
Well, more or less the kind of thing you hear around here, like more than anything, this is size X and coral, but coral is hardly out of season.
[00:03:59.270] - Speaker 1
Yes.
[00:04:01.970] - Speaker 2
Besides, everything is size X.
[00:04:08.950] - Speaker 1
And do you know of any cases of snakebite?
[00:04:14.260] - Speaker 2
My cousin here and another cousin were also bitten by the snake. But then, he wasn't really affected. Well, yes, his leg turned purple, but it wasn't too bad. On the other hand, the cousin over there, well, he almost lost his leg.
[00:04:30.340] - Speaker 1
Weren't the snakes poisonous?
[00:04:33.690] - Speaker 2
They were tall.
[00:04:39.540] - Speaker 1
How did you identify whether it was a snake, a size X or Cora?
[00:04:48.740] - Speaker 2
Because of the color, I have always lived, that is, I have always remained, I still go to the countryside, so, well, more or less already
[00:04:57.920] - Speaker 1
Yes, okay. So, let's see. Okay, I have no more questions. Do you have anything else to say about snakes?
[00:05:07.570] - Speaker 2
No, no. The only thing is to know that suddenly, when you're far away from home, what to do so that the poison doesn't act so
[00:05:24.430] - Speaker 1
Yes. Okay, thank you very much. Well, thank you. A.
