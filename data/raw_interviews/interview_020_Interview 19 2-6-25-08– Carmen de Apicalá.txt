Above all, I am separated.
[00:00:22.090] - Speaker 1
And how many years have you lived in El Carmen?
[00:00:26.750] - Speaker 2
49 years old. I was born here now.
[00:00:30.640] - Speaker 1
Okay, yes. And do you think it's likely that you'll be bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:37.680] - Speaker 2
I don't know, because I was fed up with the countryside, but I've never seen her, but no.
[00:00:41.380] - Speaker 1
Okay.
[00:00:42.200] - Speaker 2
I have not been ripped open.
[00:00:44.920] - Speaker 1
Well. Has any animal of yours ever been bitten by a snake? No. And do you know how to prevent or avoid a snakebite? I was a reservist, or I was a combat nurse and to prevent it you have to scratch it with a cross, which all the little kids did further back, always further back, while the The ointment arrives. And what would you do if you were bitten by a snake?
[00:01:24.650] - Speaker 2
What you taught me.
[00:01:26.120] - Speaker 1
Yes.
[00:01:27.280] - Speaker 2
Since I was a reservist, you say to yourself, well, because sometimes they tell you: No, that someone is being sucked, but no. You grab right there with your hands, suck and tie a hard tourniquet on top.
[00:01:45.380] - Speaker 1
And would you trust the hospital in Carmen to cure a snake bite?
[00:01:53.300] - Speaker 2
Well, suddenly they give one first aid, but not the rest.
[00:01:59.330] - Speaker 1
And would you trust other hospitals abroad?
[00:02:02.570] - Speaker 2
Well, the closest place for the antidote for the snake is Tolemayda. Tolemayda, wherever you go, that's where they have the main antidotes for that.
[00:02:18.990] - Speaker 1
And where do you feel it is more likely that a snake will bite you? In the country or at home? In the country. Why?
[00:02:29.740] - Speaker 2
Because one is in the field and one sometimes passes, that is, one goes one, two, three, and the first one who passes, if he beats her, today he rolls in a chip. And there, that is, be the second or third, but he bites because he bites.
[00:02:48.570] - Speaker 1
And can you identify whether they are poisonous or non-venomous snakes?
[00:02:52.830] - Speaker 2
Yes, of course, you say to them: No, no, such and such a color, and they gradually identify what kind of snake it is.
[00:03:04.070] - Speaker 1
And do you know of any cases of snakebite?
[00:03:07.880] - Speaker 2
Suddenly his cousins, but not the rest.
[00:03:14.730] - Speaker 1
And what happened in those cases? Did the snakebite happen in the field or in the house? In the field. In the field.
[00:03:28.620] - Speaker 2
They were in the field where they gave them to us. They were on the farm cleaning and then when a snake
[00:03:35.560] - Speaker 1
Yes.
[00:03:36.190] - Speaker 2
When you touch her, she gets all worked up and is ready to attack anyone.
[00:03:42.140] - Speaker 1
And they went to the hospital?
[00:03:48.200] - Speaker 2
Yes, of course, maybe they didn't take us to the hospital and they sent us somewhere else. I don't know where, but they sent us somewhere.
[00:03:55.100] - Speaker 1
Do you have more to say about this belly No, the snake is the only thing I was phobic about, I was very much afraid of snakes. Yes, of course, that's normal.
[00:04:09.800] - Speaker 2
But they made me carry a rubber band from a live one. I carried it for two months, they put it here. The first time I almost ripped it off.
[00:04:19.070] - Speaker 1
A boa constrictor? Yes, that one.
[00:04:21.240] - Speaker 2
But I carried it for two months and the phobia went away.
[00:04:27.090] - Speaker 1
Well. That's the main thing for the fuck. Yes, exactly. And also, if you have a snake molding, the most important method is to go to the hospital on average.
[00:04:47.150] - Speaker 2
Yes, he did. Yes.
[00:04:48.920] - Speaker 1
The hospital in Carmen does not always have antivenoms for snakebites.
[00:04:57.220] - Speaker 2
No, there's no antidote here. The antidotes are always in Tolemaida. They call the brigade here, and the brigade I know that I was in the brigade for a long time, there I know where the antidotes are, they call and once... If it's not there, they get it, they go to other stronger brigades and they get it.
[00:05:19.990] - Speaker 1
Yes. Can you go to Gerardo, Mergar and see if Espena is there? Hospitals are better.
[00:05:32.610] - Speaker 2
Yes, of course.
[00:05:36.230] - Speaker 1
Yes. I forgot, I have one more question. For both of them it is difficult to go to a hospital outside Carmen. Is it difficult or is it easy?
[00:05:56.750] - Speaker 2
Yes, what happens is that when you go here, when you arrive at the hospital, they have to call the other hospitals where they can treat you. So, here they call Gilardo: There is no vacancy, they call Ivagen: There is no vacancy. They call Ivagen, there is no group. So they start calling outside, to the hospital on the other side. At least I had that little count here and they sent me to Pereira. And there were five shifts ahead of me, a holiday. So I was the last one to leave. I was leaving on Wednesday with the people. But no, I was sick in the fight, I know all about the cuts, all that.
[00:06:41.200] - Speaker 1
Yes, okay, sure. Okay, thank you very much. I have no more questions, but very interesting. Thank you very much.
[00:06:52.240] - Speaker 2
No, thank you.
