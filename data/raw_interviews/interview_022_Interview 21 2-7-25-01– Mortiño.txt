Standing there, my husband was already dead.

I'm sorry. A widower. And how many years have you lived in El Carmen?
[00:00:38.410] - Speaker 1
Since I was born.
[00:00:40.680] - Speaker 2
Okay. Do you think it's likely that you'll be bitten by a snake here in  A couple of times you've bitten a friend with a questionnaire?
[00:00:45.640] - Speaker 1
Yes, it has happened.
[00:00:47.090] - Speaker 2
Okay. Why?
[00:00:48.670] - Speaker 1
A cousin of mine got bitten. She got bitten and it happened to be by another snake. Okay. She got bitten around here.
[00:00:57.050] - Speaker 2
Was it poisonous?
[00:00:58.530] - Speaker 1
In other words, it was a cross-shaped snake with gangrene. So, the part where it bit him, the whole part rotted. Nobody opened it up.
[00:01:12.330] - Speaker 2
And did you have antidotes for poison or not?
[00:01:19.820] - Speaker 1
Around here they use Borugo's Yet, but it's very expensive. But the antidote is the normal thing. Yes.
[00:01:30.910] - Speaker 2
The bite, what happened? Was it in the field?
[00:01:37.500] - Speaker 1
Yes, he crossed the edge of a ravine in the afternoon. In other words, he was able to cross, he asked for a ravine and the crossing stung him here in this part.
[00:01:48.860] - Speaker 2
And two years ago?
[00:01:50.780] - Speaker 1
About a year ago. A year? Yes, a year. He had to have an implant because all this was eaten away. He had to have an implant here. Do you know Javier? Javier García.
[00:02:05.590] - Speaker 2
Okay. Yes.
[00:02:06.350] - Speaker 1
A cousin of mine.
[00:02:07.430] - Speaker 2
Okay, yes. And also, have any of your animals been And do you know how to prevent or avoid a snake?
[00:02:29.340] - Speaker 1
No. No? No. No. No. No. No. The important thing is, first of all, to know what snake bit you, to go and see the whole anti-voting thing. Yes, because you can get stung by a size, you can get stung by a cover girl, you can get stung by a ringer, there are so many breeds. So, if they apply an antitoxin that is not from the same one, then it is not effective. But that is important, to know which one stung you, that is, to kill it and take it with you at the moment it stung you, and to use the antidote in the same way.
[00:03:03.380] - Speaker 2
Yes, and before that, the deadly snake bite. Do you know how to avoid a deadly bite?
[00:03:10.370] - Speaker 1
The most common thing in the field is to wear long boots, protection Yes. Yes, not to walk around in flip-flops, or in boots. Rubber boots, which are the most indispensable thing. And to look around a lot.
[00:03:24.060] - Speaker 2
Yes, look at it a lot. And at home too, do you have any prevention methods?
[00:03:30.270] - Speaker 1
Yes, that too. We play fumigar.
[00:03:32.500] - Speaker 2
Okay.
[00:03:33.100] - Speaker 1
Yes, fumigation is good because it scares her away.
[00:03:35.870] - Speaker 2
Okay, yes. Yes. Okay. What would you do if you were bitten by a snake?
[00:03:42.670] - Speaker 1
Well, immediately kill her and go to the nearest medical center.
[00:03:48.480] - Speaker 2
Which one? Carmen or another?
[00:03:51.260] - Speaker 1
No, here it's in Tolemayda, in the brigade. Usually, it's sent to a hospital, but here the essential thing where they run the institute is in Tolemayda.
[00:04:00.560] - Speaker 2
And would you trust the hospital, Carmen, to cure a woman who had been bitten by a snake? Why?
[00:04:05.940] - Speaker 1
A delay. They delay the person a lot for I mean, for you to take them by transport system. So, you know that the poison spreads very quickly. And the other important thing, when you bite an ant, tie up the part where it stung you. If it stung you here, one is to make a strong bandage.
[00:04:31.330] - Speaker 2
And would you trust other hospitals near Carmen de Picala?
[00:04:37.270] - Speaker 1
Well, it's because it's Girardó, they're good centers.
[00:04:42.680] - Speaker 2
And where do you feel it is more likely that a snake will bite you? In the countryside or at home?
[00:04:51.330] - Speaker 1
More than anything in the countryside, when I'm working, the culera, more than anything it's in the woods, where there's a lot of wood, where there's wood, where things are stashed. But there's rubbish, or rather, where there's woods. When you dig, well, you usually find them. More than anything in the countryside, the culera is
[00:05:08.780] - Speaker 2
There are many in the field, yes. And can you identify poisonous snakes or non-venomous ones?
[00:05:16.720] - Speaker 1
Well, I know the one that isn't And the one that isn't poisonous is the one they call the hunter.
[00:05:23.900] - Speaker 2
Hunter, isn't it poisonous? No. No?
[00:05:28.270] - Speaker 1
And the one who is called what? The fool.
[00:05:32.300] - Speaker 2
Yes, the fool, yes.
[00:05:35.680] - Speaker 1
But right now what's happening is that it's crossing over with the others. But anyway, it's poisonous because about three months ago I was on a farm working and one of them was eating a cat. Because she drowned it with her drool, she put it
[00:06:02.010] - Speaker 2
A fool?
[00:06:02.750] - Speaker 1
Yes, and there's also yourself. You put in a bit of effort and grab one of those silly girls and let yourself be taken down and you're not going that way, but up. You're going to go backwards and you can't. Because they take you down. So, that's how you practically hunt the animal. Yes. They take you down.
[00:06:22.990] - Speaker 2
And can you identify the brands X Cascabel and Corral? Yes, of course.
[00:06:28.190] - Speaker 1
Eight or fifteen years ago, I cut down a tree in the middle of the ravine, it was this big. It was lying asleep in the middle. But here the one they call the rotter is also very common. It's brown. It hides a lot in damp places.
[00:06:49.850] - Speaker 2
And for you, if you are bitten by a snake, is it difficult to And so to get to the hospital, is it easy?
[00:07:03.540] - Speaker 1
In that case, I think you could help quickly. A friend to take you on a motorbike. I mean, you're looking for fast transportation. Okay.
[00:07:10.310] - Speaker 2
See? Good.
[00:07:11.810] - Speaker 1
Because the faster it goes, the better, because sometimes, for example, you feel like going somewhere far away, there's no transport. So we paid Javier, my cousin, who was delayed a lot in Carmen, because they had to go at the right time. He was stung at half past five in the afternoon. Type O 7:00 at night they already had to give him the antivenom. So, the longer they take to give the antivenom, the more the poison advances.
[00:07:41.160] - Speaker 2
Yes. And with those other cases of a snakebite or just Javier?
[00:07:50.010] - Speaker 1
But that was several years ago now, a lady from the hill, the mountain range, got a small one, and the husband said no, it wasn't serious. And the lady died two days later, because they found her the next day and by then she was very swollen, she swelled up and the next day she died. And it was small, it was in the bathroom. That's how she went to have a bath and she was like that in the bath. Here there is a size that is called a cool size, that doesn't grow much anymore. That is long. It looks like a necklace of little dots like that, but then it is very poisonous. It is made up a lot like that from building blocks.
[00:08:35.980] - Speaker 2
Well, I have no more questions. Do you have more to say about snakes, more knowledge about snakes?
[00:08:43.800] - Speaker 1
Well, the most important thing is that you sprayed the houses before. Creolina is very good for that, the Huyenta.
[00:08:51.380] - Speaker 2
La Huyenta, yes.
[00:08:52.460] - Speaker 1
Yes, Creolin. And the snake is very afraid of Creolin. If I knew that Creolin pierces it I mean, you take Creolin and put a drop on a snake and it pierces it like acid. I mean, it's very strong. I mean, just for fun, do a test and take a drop of Creolin and put it on a live snake and it will pierce it. But the thing is, it's really scared of it. So, well, just fill the houses with Creolin.
[00:09:22.610] - Speaker 3
But I heard that burnt oil is the best thing there is for getting rid of snakes. Burnt oil? Yes, there are some out in the bush and they put out an empty one with burnt oil and the pythons like it a lot and that's where they leave it so
[00:09:35.480] - Speaker 1
It's how they get you and they say that when there are poisonous snakes, they feed them milk with minced horse clean. And they kill them too.
[00:09:44.500] - Speaker 3
But what is it Burnt oil is very good.
[00:09:47.470] - Speaker 1
She also told me that she found a waterfall down here. Is there one around here? On that hill?
[00:09:54.470] - Speaker 2
A coral or a sea star?
[00:09:57.060] - Speaker 1
Chorus over here. That's good, isn't it?
[00:10:00.550] - Speaker 3
And do you still have bells?
[00:10:02.480] - Speaker 1
The bellflower, the coral, is distinguished by its black rings. It has black rings. There is another one called the candle. Candle. It is red and the cabbage is white.
[00:10:17.380] - Speaker 3
We're not going anymore.
[00:10:20.160] - Speaker 1
What do they call it
[00:10:21.120] - Speaker 3
The street bells there.
[00:10:24.090] - Speaker 2
Interesting. Check.
[00:10:26.590] - Speaker 3
This one is brave. 11? 11, 12.
[00:10:32.790] - Speaker 1
No, I've been wearing it for 12 years.
[00:10:33.410] - Speaker 3
12, and I still have a few months to go until I turn 12.
[00:10:37.880] - Speaker 1
It's got plastic.
[00:10:39.670] - Speaker 2
Yes.
[00:10:40.810] - Speaker 1
That one has the property that before it stings you, it warns you. It warns you so that It shakes the maraca.
[00:10:45.030] - Speaker 3
He put it in so that I would play with it. Because when I put it in, it bit him.
[00:10:50.250] - Speaker 2
But they had been knocked down.
[00:10:51.980] - Speaker 3
That's why they were there. I found them alone.
[00:10:54.860] - Speaker 1
Are you sure it happened in a car?
[00:10:55.780] - Speaker 3
He stepped on it and knocked the shell off and there he stayed looking after them. What a pain in the ass he is.
[00:11:01.210] - Speaker 1
And I found them and I started playing with them and when I looked in front they were chipped.
[00:11:11.280] - Speaker 3
Those are the bells of the great bell. The problem with the bell is that even though it's poisonous, it's still very aggressive, that bell is going to do you in
[00:11:21.000] - Speaker 1
And now the plan is going down the ladder, there in Moqueño, now that they've killed a pure girl, but she was And big. Don't find him in a hurry.
[00:11:32.230] - Speaker 2
And you've been in Colombia for a while? Five months.
[00:11:40.510] - Speaker 1
Five months? A little bit?
[00:11:41.800] - Speaker 2
Yes, a little bit, yes.
[00:11:44.250] - Speaker 1
Are you studying?
[00:11:45.760] - Speaker 2
I am a researcher at the University of Los Andes. Yes, he studied a little, but I work a lot.
[00:11:54.820] - Speaker 1
In other words, that's what they're good at.
[00:11:56.530] - Speaker 2
Yes, exactly.
[00:11:58.670] - Speaker 1
So you go to several regions.
[00:12:00.990] - Speaker 2
Yes, I live in Bogotá. I live in Bogotá. And now here, but I work here in Carmen. My interviews are in Carmen. Yes. Well. Yes. Yes. Thank you very much.
[00:12:20.220] - Speaker 1
