[00:00:18.460] - Speaker 2
And how many years have you lived in El Carmen?
[00:00:21.900] - Speaker 1
Nine years.
[00:00:22.680] - Speaker 2
Nine years. Okay. Do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:28.870] - Speaker 1
Well, in the one I'm in, there's a risk I might get bitten by a snake, but what I don't want is for it to bite me. Nobody wants to get bitten by a snake.
[00:00:36.370] - Speaker 2
And why do you think it's likely that you'll be bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:42.300] - Speaker 1
Anyway, we are in the countryside and in forests, and you know that here on land, the snake's hot climate is abundant.
[00:00:48.480] - Speaker 2
And have any of your animals been bitten by a snake?
[00:00:53.920] - Speaker 1
Not in this sector.
[00:00:55.390] - Speaker 2
In the past, on another estate or not?
[00:00:58.520] - Speaker 1
On another estate, yes.
[00:00:59.580] - Speaker 2
Okay. Outside Carmen. In Córdoba. In Córdoba, okay. And do you know how to prevent a snakebite?
[00:01:07.610] - Speaker 1
Well, previously, I knew that you worked with petroleum jelly on animals when they came out. That was very good when a snake bit a cow and you applied petroleum jelly and all the poison was collected and that was it. But I think they've stopped doing that. Now, I don't know, they give you antibiotics and that's what you use to fight it, if you can, because if the snake is vicious, that practically kills it.
[00:01:30.030] - Speaker 2
And before a snakebite, how can you avoid a snarling?
[00:01:35.210] - Speaker 1
To a person or to an animal?
[00:01:37.760] - Speaker 2
Both.
[00:01:40.820] - Speaker 1
Nor should you expose yourself too much, because sometimes they say that the animal is still, you stayed in its habitat. So, you have to try to avoid that, not get into the risky part of the snake.
[00:01:54.430] - Speaker 2
And what would you do if you were bitten by a snake?
[00:01:58.550] - Speaker 1
Well, to immediately notify you, first aid, the doctor so they can give me an IV, whatever needs to be done, because you can see that the snake doesn't wait. That's the animal that doesn't wait.
[00:02:08.030] - Speaker 2
Yes. And which hospital, which doctor went in?
[00:02:11.490] - Speaker 1
Well, the closest place here is Carmen de Apicala.
[00:02:14.050] - Speaker 2
Would you trust the hospital, Carmen, to cure a snakebite?
[00:02:19.300] - Speaker 1
Yes, because a friend of his was stung once and they helped him and took him to Girardoy and everything, and the boy was saved.
[00:02:29.220] - Speaker 2
Would you also trust other hospitals to cure a snake bite?
[00:02:34.300] - Speaker 1
Of course, because before now there weren't any healers who said: No, Julián doesn't know how to heal, and no, today everyone runs to the hospital, to the nearest health center, they just run.
[00:02:45.580] - Speaker 2
And where do you feel it is more likely that a snake will bite you? In the countryside or at home?
[00:02:54.880] - Speaker 1
More than anything in the countryside, in the training, yes. But you try to keep the house around it clean, so that they don't come fumigated and that.
[00:03:04.420] - Speaker 2
And can you identify poisonous snakes or non-venomous ones? Yes. Okay. How?
[00:03:10.890] - Speaker 1
You know them already. I already know which one is poisonous and which one isn't. Which ones are poisonous? The warm earth is a poisonous ass, at least if you take the silly one out, which is what one calls an ear of that ass, they say it's not poisonous, it's the least risky. But the rest of the asses are dangerous.
[00:03:31.310] - Speaker 2
And do you know of any cases of snakebite? Of course. And what happened?
[00:03:37.910] - Speaker 1
No, but not around here.
[00:03:39.140] - Speaker 2
Not around here?
[00:03:39.990] - Speaker 1
No, in my country yes, because my father died in a peephole.
[00:03:43.710] - Speaker 2
In the field. In the field. Okay, that's it. I have no more questions. If you have more to say about snakes, more knowledge?
[00:03:53.450] - Speaker 1
No, not to tell you anything more about the snake. But if they were to bring us some poison to scare it away more, I would accept it, so as not to have it so close. Although they say that the ones in the paddock are not so fierce, but the ones you have over there in the village, the peleras over there that you don't pay for.
[00:04:13.390] - Speaker 2
Ready? Ready. Thank you very much.
[00:04:15.350] - Speaker 1
That they are very good.
