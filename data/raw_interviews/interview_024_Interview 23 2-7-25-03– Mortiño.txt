[00:00:19.060] - Speaker 2
And how many years have you lived in El Carmen?
[00:00:22.150] - Speaker 1
25 years.
[00:00:26.010] - Speaker 2
And do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:29.770] - Speaker 1
Probably.
[00:00:30.440] - Speaker 2
Why?
[00:00:31.340] - Speaker 1
Because there is enough variety.
[00:00:33.620] - Speaker 2
Yes. And do you know how to prevent a snakebite?
[00:00:38.650] - Speaker 1
Prevention, especially in the home, taking care of the places they get into, cleaning. Sometimes, in some places where there are a lot of them, repellents are used, for example, gasoline, creolin. Yes, it works.
[00:00:54.610] - Speaker 2
Okay, yes.
[00:00:55.560] - Speaker 1
Sometimes even burning sulfur, substances that give off a different smell. And here, as you will see, they have more or less experienced that they get stuck in certain places.
[00:01:05.920] - Speaker 2
So, you're going to be careful.
[00:01:08.060] - Speaker 1
There is a lot of variety here.
[00:01:09.630] - Speaker 2
And what do you do in the countryside too?
[00:01:13.120] - Speaker 1
In the countryside?
[00:01:14.620] - Speaker 2
If you go out into the countryside, how can you prevent one?
[00:01:17.990] - Speaker 1
No, prevent a movement with boots, initially. Be careful with that. And keep an eye on where he goes, because you know he might be there. Keep an eye out. Yes, keep an eye out. Now, if I kill him, that's another story.
[00:01:35.810] - Speaker 2
Exactly. Yes, that's what it's all about. Wearing boots, because otherwise it's impossible. Because you normally go and when I step on something. If you don't go with boots from scratch, there you go. And have any of your animals been bitten by a snake?
[00:01:54.840] - Speaker 1
Yes.
[00:01:55.340] - Speaker 2
And you know?
[00:01:57.450] - Speaker 1
It died. It died? A long time ago, maybe an X-size, it bit a piglet. Three hours later, it died.
[00:02:06.150] - Speaker 2
And what would you do if you were bitten by a snake?
[00:02:10.010] - Speaker 1
If I get bitten, initially wash with soap and water, do not make any sudden or rapid movements and seek transportation directly, identify the animal, and if possible, catch it and take it somewhere better, so that they know what it is, and go to a place where they can treat it. Here we have to turn two, the closest place where it can be solved is in Girardó.
[00:02:33.070] - Speaker 2
Why Girardó?
[00:02:35.420] - Speaker 1
Because here in the medical center, in the hospital, there is no anti-hypoxic serum. In Girardó there are more possibilities than if there isn't any, they refer you anywhere. For example, in Tolemaida, in the Lerrito station, they don't attend to anyone, it's for them. As the serum is not easy to find.
[00:02:56.930] - Speaker 2
And if you need to go to hospital, is it difficult or easy to get there?
[00:03:04.110] - Speaker 1
Do you fall on a motorbike? Yes, on a motorbike, on a vehicle.
[00:03:06.760] - Speaker 2
You have a motorbike.
[00:03:08.680] - Speaker 1
Here, generally speaking, almost all of us have some form of transport.
[00:03:13.430] - Speaker 2
And where do you think you are most likely to be bitten by a snake? In the fields or in the house?
[00:03:22.560] - Speaker 1
No, in the countryside.
[00:03:23.000] - Speaker 2
In the countryside. Why?
[00:03:26.050] - Speaker 1
Here, for example, it has happened to us that when there are fires up in the mountains, they come down to escape the fire. We've killed two rattlesnakes here, right? Two rattlesnakes here. Here the house is removed, but they come from above. Now, they respect the area where the man is very much, because if one sees them, one has to avoid them, one has to attack them. If you know they're there, you have to avoid them. And they avoid you too. They attack if they feel they're being attacked. It's the only way. Here it's very likely, because there's a lot of variety here. There are X species, there are Corals. Rot, four-nose, all kinds. Leaf fish, rattlesnakes and crosses too. That's a lot.
[00:04:21.990] - Speaker 2
And can you tell whether snakes are poisonous or non-venomous? Yes.
[00:04:29.510] - Speaker 1
Well, morphologically, because of the shape of the head, the teeth and they have to do with the colors, for example. Yes, exactly. Because here one more or less knows the varieties that there are, little things, one more or less the color.
[00:04:46.780] - Speaker 2
Exactly. And, well, do you know of a case of a snake eating itself? Yes. What happened?
[00:04:55.980] - Speaker 1
In one case where I managed to help the man, I took him to the site. I took him directly from the village to the site. He came from the countryside and I took him to the site on my motorbike as far as Gilardón. And he was saved because it wasn't very toxic. It was dangerous, but it wasn't very toxic.
[00:05:13.990] - Speaker 2
Okay, good. Okay, done. I have no more questions. Do you have anything else to say about snakes or knowledge about snakes?
[00:05:22.990] - Speaker 1
Well, the others, the snakes, the silver ones.
[00:05:27.640] - Speaker 2
And with that, right?
[00:05:30.670] - Speaker 1
Yes.
