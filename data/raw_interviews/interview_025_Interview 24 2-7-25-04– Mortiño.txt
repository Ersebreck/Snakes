Interview 24 2-7-25-04– Mortiño
[00:00:00.000] - Speaker 1
It already went wrong for me.
[00:00:01.840] - Speaker 2
Well, I'm finished. Excuse me. No, no. Thank you. Thank you very much. Okay. Okay. What's your name? Cristela Cartagena. And you're from? Yes. With the interview and the recording.
[00:00:16.830] - Speaker 1
Let's see what I can add, because this
[00:00:19.290] - Speaker 2
Yes, it's the same thing. And how old are you?
[00:00:22.820] - Speaker 1
59.
[00:00:24.260] - Speaker 2
And what do you do for a living?
[00:00:26.580] - Speaker 1
Here with animals.
[00:00:29.020] - Speaker 2
And you are? Are you married or single? Married. And how many years have you lived in El Carmen?
[00:00:35.980] - Speaker 1
I am born.
[00:00:38.100] - Speaker 2
And do you think it's likely that a snake will kill you? Of course. Why?
[00:00:42.720] - Speaker 1
Because you are more How do they call it? Prone to being stung in the area where you live. You have to clean, even there with the animals, I have even gone and cured the scorpions there. Sometimes they settle in the nesting boxes. Several times, they go like two or three times, you go and there they are. And it's dangerous, you go and you don't realize it, you put your hand in and there you get stung. When cleaning, in the banana plantation. So, because of that, of course, one is more willing to get stung.
[00:01:19.160] - Speaker 2
And do you know how to prevent a snakebite or avoid one?
[00:01:25.230] - Speaker 1
No, more than anything to protect yourself and be careful. In that case, there in the case of my animals, I have to be on the lookout. Or they sometimes let you know when they hear a bleat in an animal, then they make a fuss, then you're kind of on the lookout, more than anything. There with the animals, out in the field, you have to protect yourself with boots and stuff.
[00:01:46.990] - Speaker 2
No, oh dear, I'm not going to do it. And what would you do if you were bitten by a snake?
[00:01:53.710] - Speaker 1
Well, I would have to go out and look for the village. If one doesn't have a way to at least go to the village, and there they help you out with transportation or something, they give you something while you get to the place which is Girardot?
[00:02:08.450] - Speaker 2
Girardot. Would you trust the Carmen, the hospital in the Carmen, to cure a blackberry and cry about a snake? No, suddenly to stop
[00:02:16.850] - Speaker 1
What do they call it? Helping you while you can get out, but once you're there there's no way they can save you.
[00:02:28.640] - Speaker 2
And where do you feel it is more likely that a snake will bite you? In the countryside or at home?
[00:02:37.210] - Speaker 1
Well, here in the countryside she can come in, she can come to the house. But I mean, that's almost the same thing, isn't it? Because here they have come into the house. And the one we killed there, she was coming this way. And they pass by. So once I was there going into the room and one of them was passing by. The kitten was there and she came towards me and when she saw it, she just stood there. I said: Look, what's this? She warned me that there was an animal. So, you have to be like it's night-time, you have to be watching with the torches and shining a light where it's going to pass to live. That's what you have to do, as there is another one.
[00:03:18.690] - Speaker 2
And can you identify poisonous snakes or non-venomous ones?
[00:03:24.480] - Speaker 1
No, no. Soon not all of them. Not all of them, yes. But yes, the important ones. Like the cascabela, the coral one with the orange colors. There's one they call, that's pink, pink. By now you also more or less know how to identify them.
[00:03:46.350] - Speaker 2
And do you know of any cases of snakebite? Any other cases?
[00:03:52.190] - Speaker 1
No, not another one. Not the ones I'm living through.
[00:03:55.070] - Speaker 2
Okay.
[00:03:55.290] - Speaker 1
Yes, the same ones.
[00:03:57.730] - Speaker 2
Well. Done. That's it. Thank you very much. Do you have anything else to say about snakes or your knowledge of them?
[00:04:06.570] - Speaker 1
Of what?
[00:04:07.110] - Speaker 2
Sorry. You have more to say about snakes. No.
[00:04:11.400] - Speaker 1
Alright. You're going for Colombia.
