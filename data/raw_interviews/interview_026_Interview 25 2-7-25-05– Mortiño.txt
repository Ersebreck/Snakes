Well, yes.
[00:00:12.150] - Speaker 3
Okay, thank you. How old are you?

[00:00:17.020] - Speaker 3

[00:00:22.590] - Speaker 3
And are you married or single?
[00:00:25.800] - Speaker 1
No, they're not married.
[00:00:27.870] - Speaker 3
And how many years have you lived in El Carmen?
[00:00:31.350] - Speaker 1
Since I was born, 66 years.
[00:00:33.660] - Speaker 3
All your life. And do you think it's likely that you'll be bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:41.980] - Speaker 1
Well, that's never happened to me, but very close friends of ours have been bitten and have been seriously ill. For example, a friend from Picalá, Javier, he was bitten once and it was very serious, they almost took his leg off. But we, thank God, never, I've seen them, but we've never had that failure. A cousin of mine did die from a snakebite, a first cousin. She died about five or six years ago from a snakebite.
[00:01:17.270] - Speaker 3
In the Carmen or outside?
[00:01:18.810] - Speaker 1
Here I didn't see anyone on the other sidewalk, but also from here in Carmen.
[00:01:22.550] - Speaker 3
And what happened? Did the snake bite her in the field?
[00:01:26.600] - Speaker 1
She was bitten by a snake in the field. And she No, she went to the doctor the next day and threw us out: And is she going to throw out the lemon? No way. Then I heard those cats.
[00:01:39.790] - Speaker 2
The cats are just being naughty.
[00:01:42.370] - Speaker 1
And she started to throw things at the hard one, so when they took her to the doctor after three days to get an injection, her leg was already this swollen.
[00:01:53.360] - Speaker 2
And she was bitten by a small snake, they say it was a viper, I don't know, I don't know them.
[00:01:58.540] - Speaker 1
And that animal bit her and they couldn't get the poison out and she died of poisoning. Mine.
[00:02:04.850] - Speaker 3
Okay. Didn't he need antidotes for?
[00:02:13.330] - Speaker 1
Yes, she needed it, but they didn't bring it in time.
[00:02:16.200] - Speaker 3
Okay, I understand.
[00:02:17.810] - Speaker 1
Then she died of blood poisoning.
[00:02:23.890] - Speaker 3
And have any of your animals been bitten by a snake?
[00:02:32.830] - Speaker 1
I don't understand.
[00:02:34.170] - Speaker 3
Has any animal of yours been bitten by a snake? Has any animal of yours been bitten by a snake?
[00:02:42.830] - Speaker 1
Any animals? Yes, and a pet, mom.
[00:02:44.230] - Speaker 3
Yes, a pet.
[00:02:46.120] - Speaker 1
Little animals? No.
[00:02:48.500] - Speaker 3
Okay, good.
[00:02:49.530] - Speaker 1
No, ma'am, no.
[00:02:50.760] - Speaker 3
And do you know how to prevent a snakebite?
[00:02:58.140] - Speaker 1
Not so far, why? To us. We're a long way from El Carmen and they never tell us anything.
[00:03:05.290] - Speaker 2
Animals get in, snakes, but they kill them because one like is going to get in there.
[00:03:11.420] - Speaker 1
For example, not long ago one of those big ones came along the road. My daughter and I were coming along and the snake was slithering along slowly. So she hit the brakes and turned the motorbike round to go and get someone to kill it.
[00:03:25.180] - Speaker 2
By the time we turned around, the animal was already gone. And my daughter says it was a cross between sizes, I don't know what they are, but she says it was a cross between sizes because it was kind of shaggy. So we didn't go back on the motorbike to look for someone to kill it, but as it was in a forest there, at the foot of a fence, she went in there. The man didn't find her there, she must have gone far away, but it was very big.
[00:03:55.960] - Speaker 1
There are huge snakes around here. Yes, yes.
[00:04:01.140] - Speaker 3
And what would you do if you were bitten by a snake?
[00:04:07.210] - Speaker 1
The first thing is to go to the doctor, because that's what else they do.
[00:04:11.020] - Speaker 3
And which hospital?
[00:04:13.450] - Speaker 2
Well, I'd have to go to Melgar, where they have the equipment to treat you. Here in El Carmen, that hospital, it's useless. They just let you die there.
[00:04:24.990] - Speaker 3
And where do you feel it is more likely that a snake will bite you? In the countryside or at home?
[00:04:33.610] - Speaker 1
Well, just the same. Because in a house where there is a bug, that's it, and you don't see it and you step on it in the dark, it can bite you.
[00:04:42.980] - Speaker 2
And in the forest, the same thing, if you go over there and they don't see you and step on you or you're close by, it can bite you. Look, here, passing the bridge this way to go to the Tulio estate, there, Doña Alba, the wife of kings, she found some little things like this and she started to collect them and she started to do this, to play and that's what she does like this
[00:05:07.530] - Speaker 1
And he started playing with little things like that, little eggshells.
[00:05:11.040] - Speaker 2
And when she turned to look at the snake, it was already about to get hold of her and throw her. And it was a tremendous snake and it had thrown away all those little things, that surely some car must have knocked them over, I don't know. At her house, she started to play with it there, curled up. And when she turned to look and said, "And what was this?" And she turned to look and the animal was already tying her up, but looking to come they hit her. Because they get very angry when they take those little things away from them.
[00:05:40.130] - Speaker 3
Yes, okay. In the house too and in the field.
[00:05:46.100] - Speaker 2
Right here.
[00:05:48.400] - Speaker 3
Yes, very close.
[00:05:50.790] - Speaker 1
On that bridge over there.
[00:05:53.200] - Speaker 3
And can you identify poisonous snakes or non-venomous ones?
[00:05:58.280] - Speaker 1
There are different ones. There are some that are too poisonous, which is like the stature, the one I'm mentioning.
[00:06:06.080] - Speaker 3
And do you know how to identify the poisonous ones? Yes or no? No. And well, do you know? Yes, okay, good. Well, I have no more questions. Do you have anything else to say about snakes? Your experiences with snakes or your knowledge?
[00:06:34.310] - Speaker 1
No, because I know about them and the choir and the statue and all that, but I've never been attacked, because you have to be careful. Yes. You see one of those animals and you ask someone else to come and kill it.
[00:06:51.860] - Speaker 2
Because, for example, I wouldn't get involved in killing her because I get nervous around her and I would run away.
[00:06:57.790] - Speaker 3
Yes, of course.
[00:06:59.750] - Speaker 1
Of course. Of course. Thank you very much. Well, yes, ma'am.
