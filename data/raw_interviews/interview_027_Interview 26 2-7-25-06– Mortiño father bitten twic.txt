Already 56 years old.
[00:06:50.610] - Speaker 3
Okay, yes, all your life.
[00:06:51.770] - Speaker 2
I was born, or rather, I grew up here in Mortiño.
[00:06:54.900] - Speaker 3
And do you think it's likely that you'll be bitten by a snake here?
[00:07:01.960] - Speaker 2
No.
[00:07:02.570] - Speaker 3
Isn't it probable or is it probable?
[00:07:06.130] - Speaker 2
No, no. It can't be probable.
[00:07:09.560] - Speaker 3
Okay. Why?
[00:07:11.320] - Speaker 2
Because you have to be very careful with
[00:07:14.410] - Speaker 3
Yes, yes. Okay, good. And have any of your animals been bitten by a snake?
[00:07:22.910] - Speaker 2
A relative?
[00:07:24.060] - Speaker 3
An animal of yours.
[00:07:25.880] - Speaker 2
An animal?
[00:07:26.470] - Speaker 3
Animal.
[00:07:27.180] - Speaker 2
No. No? No.
[00:07:28.880] - Speaker 3
Well. And what would you do? I'm sorry. Do you know how to prevent or avoid snakebite?
[00:07:38.540] - Speaker 2
Well, I say what he hears today. He says, "They have to make a small cut and let the blood come out, while one gets to the nearest center."
[00:07:54.010] - Speaker 3
But before the grinding, how do you avoid a snake and how do you avoid giving a death? I don't know, don't you? No. No problem. And what would you do if you were bitten by a snake?
[00:08:13.990] - Speaker 2
What I'm saying is, find a way to get to the nearest center.
[00:08:20.590] - Speaker 3
Is the nearest center Carmen or is it? Yes, ma'am. Would you trust the hospital, Carmen de Apicala?
[00:08:27.540] - Speaker 2
No, he trusted Carmen de Apicala very much, he trusted the hospital in Carmen de Apicala. Why? Because recently, a cousin of mine, well, there, I should say almost lost his So, what you're saying is that he's almost more lost than... And I think you made the distinction, with the son of the deceased, Florentino García. We already took him in 30. He lasted a long time there, the Chinese yearling lasted, so to speak.
[00:08:54.800] - Speaker 3
Yes.
[00:08:56.220] - Speaker 2
So, just now when I got to my husband, the same thing happened to me, as I said, what if he had been a poisonous animal. They attended to him after three hours. After three hours. After three hours they attended to him. As I said, what if he had been a poisonous animal. So, you can't be too careful.
[00:09:11.590] - Speaker 1
The poison stopped, the whole body there.
[00:09:14.130] - Speaker 3
Yes.
[00:09:14.290] - Speaker 2
So, he didn't trust me there anymore.
[00:09:18.450] - Speaker 3
And would you trust other hospitals outside, Carmen? In Girardón. In Girardón, okay. Why in Girardón?
[00:09:28.940] - Speaker 2
Because once you're there, for example, my dad was bitten by a snake twice and he was sent straight there.
[00:09:38.420] - Speaker 3
Your dad? Yes, my dad. Serpent is poisonous.
[00:09:43.180] - Speaker 2
Yes, size X.
[00:09:44.990] - Speaker 3
And your dad had two X-sized snake bites? Yes.
[00:09:53.610] - Speaker 2
The first one was almost two meters long. And the last one was about this long, the second one that the last one bit.
[00:10:05.170] - Speaker 3
And your dad, is he alive?
[00:10:09.260] - Speaker 2
He's already passed away, but it's been a while since he was bitten and he controlled himself, because at that time there was no transportation to turn everything around and he had to play, so to speak. And with what he controlled himself at that time, he would make himself a little bowl of oil. At that time, you could get all the oil you wanted. He would take his bowl of oil and make the little cut there. And that's how Girardón arrived.
[00:10:35.150] - Speaker 3
And where does he live? My dad?
[00:10:39.990] - Speaker 2
Yes. He's already passed away. He passed away a year ago.
[00:10:46.070] - Speaker 3
And what about the snake bites for your dad? Were they in the field or in the house?
[00:10:56.890] - Speaker 2
I was in How should I put it? I was working. Yes, doing manual labor, but like in the mountains, I mean, in... In the countryside. Clearing away the rubble, digging holes, how do you say that?
[00:11:11.730] - Speaker 3
How mean. As if to fence it in.
[00:11:14.380] - Speaker 2
By cutting down trees, I mean, what was it for
[00:11:17.720] - Speaker 3
Okay, yes, that's bad, two snake bites is bad. And where do you feel it is more likely that a snake will bite you? In the countryside or at home?
[00:11:33.970] - Speaker 2
Well, one, or rather, one can be anywhere and one can be a victim of those little critters. Like her, always from the farm where we are, we were already between dark and light, and she was going ahead. And we were going along the path like that when I saw that girl get wrapped up. I didn't just do nothing and not catch her. She probably put her foot on the snake's head and it didn't bite her. She was very small, three or four years old. But I picked her up, I ran back to the house and I didn't just run, I kept looking at her to see if it had bitten me. And I saw that as a warning, because they are the ones who most like to go out at that time of It's a little dark out at that time of night to be going out.
[00:12:22.780] - Speaker 3
Exactly. And can you tell the difference between poisonous and non-venomous snakes?
[00:12:29.880] - Speaker 2
The ones I know best are size X and the rotting one and the B bark. Those are the I don't know which ones the rest were bad.
[00:12:43.040] - Speaker 3
Well, I don't have any more questions for you, but you have more to say about snakes, more experiences, more knowledge.
[00:12:55.510] - Speaker 2
No, I don't have that much knowledge. I mean, you would like to learn, really, to avoid being bitten. Yes, I would like to learn that.
[00:13:06.520] - Speaker 3
Yes, after the interview, yes, I can explain more. Thank you very much. Okay.
