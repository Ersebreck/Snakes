And how old are you? 59. And what do you do? Do you still work?
[00:00:10.870] - Speaker 2
Right now I'm resting.
[00:00:13.760] - Speaker 1
Okay, good. Because when you work on something you finish it.
[00:00:17.960] - Speaker 2
Yes.
[00:00:19.700] - Speaker 1
For that job. Are you married or single? Yes. And how many years have you lived in El Carmen? As long as I've Do you think it's likely that you'll be bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:36.820] - Speaker 2
Yes, of course, because wherever you go you can find one, like the one that bit me. It was on the table. I came here to open the drawer, I opened the drawer with this hand and I sent the hand here to the key to go and fix the motorbike and there it was and it didn't sting me here.
[00:00:53.630] - Speaker 1
What kind of snake?
[00:00:55.880] - Speaker 2
No, but it wasn't a  When I saw the color, I saw that it was a putrid one, and I said: Oops, they do dance.
[00:01:04.280] - Speaker 4
It's a cross-eyed fool, I can't remember the name they told us, a cross-eyed fool.
[00:01:08.530] - Speaker 2
Yes, because it was kind of dark, kind of reddish. We killed it and opened it up, and we had these cormels, then a lot of blood came out. That's where the blood is dripping from. So, we went to the hospital.
[00:01:25.200] - Speaker 1
Did you go to the hospital? Yes, of course.
[00:01:27.200] - Speaker 2
Immediately? We carry it in a bag.
[00:01:31.830] - Speaker 1
Well. Yes.
[00:01:33.360] - Speaker 2
And I waited until they attended to me and on the way back that doctor went to have a look. To see that the gentleman is already waiting. And I went back there. Three hours later. Go on. Three hours. And they had already taken a photo of the snake. And what snake did they put in? Where have they got it? That's the one I took a photo of outside. I said to him: Well, mate, because this guy, because here they're going to make me bring snakes here. No, wait, I'm going to send the photo to a specialist, to a doctor who
[00:02:06.930] - Speaker 1
And you went to the Carmen, to the hospital in Carmen.
[00:02:10.500] - Speaker 2
And I went, wait, until there was no answer, the doctor said to look at her in the photo, when I didn't, that she wasn't dangerous, that she wasn't poisonous. But nevertheless, wash there with soap. That was the only thing he did for me. Take it home. They didn't apply anything at all, an antibiotic.
[00:02:34.940] - Speaker 4
An antibiotic, because in then like after 15 days, 8 days?
[00:02:39.290] - Speaker 2
After 8 days. This gave me a rash on my thighs and my finger. But a rash So, it's going to be an effect No, I found something a little black that I with the money and I didn't even take it off and I doused it in alcohol. I did.
[00:02:55.770] - Speaker 1
Does dying hurt a lot?
[00:02:59.520] - Speaker 2
At the time I didn't feel anything. That blood came out without, like a tingling. But suddenly, because it wasn't poisonous. Suddenly, because it wasn't poisonous, yes. Because they say that when it is poisonous, it will give you pain.
[00:03:17.380] - Speaker 1
Yes, exactly.
[00:03:18.270] - Speaker 2
But I was buzzing just a little bit, yes. But no more. Just a little.
[00:03:24.830] - Speaker 1
And before a snake bite, do you know how to prevent or avoid a bite?
[00:03:32.060] - Speaker 2
Well, if you see one in time, don't get too close, because if it was like that, don't get too close.
[00:03:45.110] - Speaker 1
And would you also trust other nearby hospitals?
[00:03:49.730] - Speaker 2
Yes, at Hidratun, because how come that, such and such a serum, they get it so easily. That's why it happened to Javier, because they didn't leave it in the hospital there in the carme and it lasted a long time.
[00:04:02.920] - Speaker 1
If you had to suffer another snakebite, what would you do?
[00:04:13.380] - Speaker 2
Immediate start. And if you see one that is poisonous, it is not lighter to start, but to turn.
[00:04:17.910] - Speaker 1
To turn.
[00:04:18.700] - Speaker 2
Sure. Yes, of course, because I find it a lighter serum.
[00:04:25.080] - Speaker 1
And where do you feel it is more likely that a snake will bite you? In the country or at home? In the country.
[00:04:33.680] - Speaker 2
Yes, because you're over there, in our eye, where they live more.
[00:04:42.360] - Speaker 1
And can you identify poisonous snakes or novenas? Yes, of course. How?
[00:04:47.520] - Speaker 2
The size X has very pronounced X's. The rattlesnake has a small, a tail. And the coral snake, a stripe of red and black. And the mud snake is a kind of dark brown color. Those are the most dangerous there are.
[00:05:10.890] - Speaker 1
And do you know of any other cases of snake bites?
[00:05:17.990] - Speaker 2
Well, a man who lived here, because I don't know where he went now, he's been here about two months, he was bitten by a coral, he's a neighbor. But I don't know Did you see what happened to him? We heard that they were treating him, that they had already given him the serum, but we didn't see him again. We haven't heard what happened to him. And it was a coral, they're more dangerous.
[00:05:44.210] - Speaker 1
Well, I have no more questions. Do you have anything else to say about snakes? No. Well, thank you very much. And also to inform you, the best thing is if you have a snake bite, go to the hospital immediately. And in El Carmen, you know, there aren't many antivenoms. It's better to go to It's best to go to Melgar, and Bagué, Girado, Espinal. And to avoid a snake bite in the house, it's important to clean everything, because snakes like garbage and at night also use a flashlight. Flashlight. Yes, flashlight. And also in the countryside it's important to be very vigilant for snakes. And more at night. And more at night, because yes, they are out more at night.
[00:07:04.390] - Speaker 2
Because the brave one goes out walking at night.
[00:07:08.680] - Speaker 1
Yes. And more, Tulio? What else? To prevent, you have more.
[00:07:15.570] - Speaker 2
The eye. The eye.
[00:07:18.160] - Speaker 3
Put on your boots on the day you go out into the mountains.
[00:07:21.190] - Speaker 2
Yes, they do tread on you with their rubber boots, but one always gets bitten anyway, it's always the small fry that get hurt.
[00:07:27.970] - Speaker 3
Yes, they're passing the boot.
[00:07:28.940] - Speaker 2
Yes, of course, rubber boots happen. A cousin of hers was coming, one afternoon he went to Like every afternoon the cattle went into the corral. He went and opened the gate and went to open the cows and the cowherd was there with the stick in the stump and he didn't realize it. And when they passed, the cows and donkeys fought over him and when he went to close the gate, the man came running over. He fell on top of her. And he almost...
[00:07:54.530] - Speaker 3
The big ones have big fangs.
[00:07:56.130] - Speaker 2
Sure. And they passed them here and took them to go to  Hey, do you think those little rats are hard to ...? Yes, the boot is useful. Yes, it won't open it. It doesn't have a long tusk, yes.
[00:08:06.030] - Speaker 3
No, they don't open it that much
[00:08:08.390] - Speaker 2
No, it doesn't have a long tusk. No, they don't open that wide. No, it doesn't have a long tusk. The tusk is short, it doesn't sing to make On the other hand, a grande does have a long tusk.
[00:08:14.720] - Speaker 3
One of the big ones is losing an eye
[00:08:17.480] - Speaker 2
Of course.
[00:08:18.610] - Speaker 3
But that's prevention.
[00:08:22.810] - Speaker 2
Of course, the boot, yes, of course. And The eye.
[00:08:25.840] - Speaker 3
And people just go for a walk.
[00:08:28.680] - Speaker 2
The eye.
[00:08:29.310] - Speaker 1
Yes. For education, the most important thing is to go to the hospital immediately if you have been bitten by a snake.
[00:08:40.790] - Speaker 2
Immediately touch that.
[00:08:41.660] - Speaker 1
Don't wait. Don't wait. Because antidotes are the only solution.
[00:08:53.300] - Speaker 2
The counter.
[00:08:54.920] - Speaker 4
And for one, that is, from here on out, what can be done before? No, no, nothing.
[00:09:03.610] - Speaker 3
That's what, according to I don't know if you've seen it around here, Charlie and Diego, who are also studying that stuff about brain poisons. And what they say is that a lot of people, if it stings them here, they get totally screwed up. That's the worst thing. It can't be done.
[00:09:24.900] - Speaker 1
It can't be done.
[00:09:25.850] - Speaker 3
Because the poison accumulates and damages the tissues.
[00:09:29.070] - Speaker 2
That's what happened to Javier. Yes, that's what happened.
[00:09:30.910] - Speaker 3
He became twisted. The poison rotted him all over, his prison was wide open.
[00:09:35.270] - Speaker 2
Why? Because it didn't circulate upwards. It didn't circulate and it wasn't stored.
[00:09:37.720] - Speaker 3
You have to let it circulate. And get to the hospital fast.
[00:09:41.450] - Speaker 2
Immediately, of course.
[00:09:42.030] - Speaker 4
I think dad would make a horseshoe, he would cut himself.
[00:09:46.100] - Speaker 2
Let him bleed.
[00:09:46.500] - Speaker 3
That he would bleed. Yes, for example, as it goes
[00:09:48.720] - Speaker 4
It came out lighter and he would order a jug of oil. And if we didn't have any in the house, they would send us out to get the oil, and he would drink his jug of oil before we got to Girardón.
[00:10:02.540] - Speaker 3
That helped.
[00:10:05.710] - Speaker 2
To control something. And as at that time there was no passage through here, we had to go through Milgar.
[00:10:10.960] - Speaker 3
Those were the remedies of the ancient lords.
[00:10:16.850] - Speaker 2
From the ancients, yes.
[00:10:18.420] - Speaker 1
From my grandparents. Yes.
[00:10:21.540] - Speaker 3
Luis, a man from there, from Cuatro Esquinas, was working. He's also very afraid of snakes. He was working on a farm and got wrapped up in some wire. And when he felt himself being wrapped up, he saw that he was bleeding. And they saw that a snake had bitten me. He said: A snake bit me. But we were wondering if the snake was under the stick, but later on, the snake didn't bite him. It was a wire rope that got him. Good for him. And the scared man started running up there to the box, imagine, where there was a Martian filling. And that was the one with the old digits and he said to him: Son, if it was a snake that bit you, here. When there was still oil, he said: Take this little bowl of oil. He said: That will help. And another neighbor came and said: Another kind of thing to take to avoid that too. He would take whatever he was told, and he wanted to be scared.
[00:11:26.968] - Speaker 3
And the snake didn't
[00:11:28.540] - Speaker 2
It was a wire bomb, it disfigured him.
[00:11:32.360] - Speaker 3
And the snake was there further on, but far away. And that one didn't  Did you see that the snake killed it?
[00:11:38.320] - Speaker 2
Of course.
[00:11:38.700] - Speaker 3
And what kind of snake was it? It was a size, but it was far away. Where he said it had bitten him. There was the wire rope and he wrinkled it and the two realized it, and he thought it was a snake.
[00:11:49.730] - Speaker 1
The scare.
[00:11:51.510] - Speaker 2
What if it had gone over there and they were going to put the old one back? What they do is poison, maybe you should have one of those pending too. That one has really been bitten, but as Tulio says
[00:12:03.830] - Speaker 3
And he, about being scared and that, he went to bed, he spread a cloth on the floor, on the.
