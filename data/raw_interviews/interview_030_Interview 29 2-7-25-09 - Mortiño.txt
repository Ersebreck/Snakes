[00:00:32.650] - Speaker 1
And how many years have you lived in El Carmen?
[00:00:36.600] - Speaker 2
All my life.
[00:00:38.970] - Speaker 1
Do you think it's likely that you'll be bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:43.090] - Speaker 2
Yes, of course, that's why. Why? Because sometimes they turn up and sometimes they don't. They don't show themselves or they're just there like that, when you feel it, the bull came out one night, at about eight o'clock, one of my sisters came out, she was going to the bathroom and it was in a room like that, it went past the room and so on to the bathroom. She was going to the bathroom and when she felt him playing, they looked at a snake, but yeah, small, size X. Well, he bit her and since that doesn't hurt right away. So, they already told her to come to the village for remedies. I said: No, not anymore. Oh, my. And they turn her on like That was at about eight at night and they came at about one in the morning, but already, serious. Vomiting, looseness. And it started and it got to Carmen, and then they threw her out to turn everything, and no, there she had...
[00:02:02.876] - Speaker 2
But already... That, since the brain takes over, the poison has no salvation. That's how she died from it.
[00:02:13.410] - Speaker 1
Your sister?
[00:02:14.300] - Speaker 2
Yes, my sister. I'm sorry. And the little one, the snake, wasn't big. How awful. But it was also pure neglect on her part for not having taken the road. Of course it is far away, but by that time they would have spent an hour at Carmen's, and it was no longer enough to stop the poison.
[00:02:36.350] - Speaker 1
How long ago?
[00:02:39.840] - Speaker 2
That makes it like that That's been going on for a while now. About four or five years, right, Tulú? I think so.
[00:02:51.590] - Speaker 1
Yes. I'm very sorry, burned.
[00:02:55.470] - Speaker 2
Yes, around here on the plan, several have been in a bad way, for example, there was Pocón, a boy, well he has a smallholding, Blaneltino's son, he bit it, and his whole leg got polished, you look at him, he was skinny like a ditch, because the flesh rotted. He was there, but to hang up the shoes.
[00:03:28.940] - Speaker 1
Yes, how awful.
[00:03:30.970] - Speaker 2
And what salvation do you bring me for that?
[00:03:33.940] - Speaker 1
What? I'm sorry.
[00:03:36.180] - Speaker 2
What salvation is there to save oneself from that? Do you bring something to prevent that thing?
[00:03:45.490] - Speaker 1
Yes. No. I have information, but yes. Yes. Have any of your animals been bitten by a snake?
[00:03:59.610] - Speaker 2
¿a ¿Is my bus normal? Yes. No. But around here, cattle, leopards have been killed. Here, for example, in front where I was on the right hand side a little lake there in front of Teo's fields. There in the Antico, that day we were over there. We were clearing that with a scythe. When once a little hill like that, and it wasn't so tame, so let's say, throwing up slobber and tame it. And no, after a while it bites there. And we keep clearing, cleaning. When we found the snake, it was still like a big cat. Well, that was the one that had killed the heifer. A Hugo heifer it was. Over there a bull, but big now. That steer belonged to Inés Galliano, and the snake killed it. I said: Well, I saw it over there, the steer lying there. And they hadn't noticed, Andrés hadn't noticed. The bare-assed bullfighters had it. And I said: They're not starting this.
[00:05:28.364] - Speaker 2
And I went and castrated the horns on the little ears and the hooves. Then, snake bites. Afterwards, they found her, but she was huge, a real cow. Yes, ma'am.
[00:05:44.850] - Speaker 1
And do you know how to prevent a snakebite or avoid a snakebite?
[00:05:56.800] - Speaker 2
No. I don't know how, because they don't warn you, so there's no way to prevent a bite.
[00:06:11.500] - Speaker 1
And what would you do if you were bitten by a snake?
[00:06:19.640] - Speaker 2
Get one for the hospital and see what remedies they give him.
[00:06:23.870] - Speaker 1
Which hospital? In El Carmen? Yes. Would you trust the hospital in El Carmen to cure a snakebite?
[00:06:32.320] - Speaker 2
But you can't get that serum there Alpidio is it? What is it? Anti-federico. The anti-federico, for me? Anti-federico, yes. Yes. That's the one they apply for that, to avoid the polen bite.
[00:06:52.250] - Speaker 1
Yes, exactly. And would you trust other hospitals to cure a snake bite too?
[00:06:58.800] - Speaker 2
They throw one out to make room for two. Not in El Carmen.
[00:07:03.070] - Speaker 1
And where do you feel it is more likely that you will be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:07:13.760] - Speaker 2
Over there, in the field, in the paddock. Of course, one night there was a flying snake. We were coming from there, where Mercedes was, or something like that. And it was like this. And Avelina stepped on it and when it flew away, she said: Look at the snake. And I said to her: Bring me a stick. And we killed it, but a big one.
[00:07:43.880] - Speaker 1
And can you identify poisonous snakes or non-venomous ones?
[00:07:52.580] - Speaker 2
Of course, around here you already know which ones are poisonous and which aren't.
[00:07:57.590] - Speaker 1
Which are poisonous?
[00:07:59.590] - Speaker 2
Around here the poisonous ones are the rattlesnake, the X-size, the coral snake. Me, more than anything, those. Because there's one called the hunter, that one's not poisonous. The mitado, neither. They call it the perdisera, mitado, neither. Well, they call it the perdisera, mitado. The dormilón, the bejuca, those aren't poisonous either. Well. Put the torches on it, I don't know if it will be This isn't poisonous either.
[00:08:36.890] - Speaker 1
And for you, if you need to go to the hospital for a snake bite? Of course. Is it difficult for you to go to the hospital or is it easy?
[00:08:51.020] - Speaker 2
Well, it's easy here, longos. You grab a motorbike and you run.
[00:08:56.270] - Speaker 1
Well, yes.
[00:08:56.850] - Speaker 2
Or a motorbike taxi.
[00:09:00.000] - Speaker 1
Okay, I have no more questions for you. Do you have more to say about snakes, more experiences or more knowledge? No. No? No. Okay. Well, thank you very much.
[00:09:15.230] - Speaker 2
To you.
[00:09:17.230] - Speaker 1
Thank you. And also my most important information is if you bite a snake. It is important to go to the hospital on average and the hospital in Carmen does not always have the anti-physicist. Of course. Melgar, Espinal, Giradur and down, are better.
[00:09:46.880] - Speaker 2
Yes, for example, in Melgar dice or in Tolemaida, they get it right there, that's where it doesn't fail.
[00:09:58.900] - Speaker 1
But anyway, thank you very much for your time. No, to you. Thank you, very interesting.
[00:10:05.560] - Speaker 2
And he's coming here a lot, you know. How long is he going to be in San Pedro?
[00:10:13.320] - Speaker 1
No. She lives in Bogotá, but now in Carmen for a month, two months. Yes, with Tulio. Because she's there. When she goes, she comes to Guaya.
[00:10:26.900] - Speaker 2
Yes.
