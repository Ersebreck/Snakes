What happened?
[00:00:59.830] - Speaker 1
No, I was over here on a farm, here in the media. I lived there in the media. And I went to cut a stick of firewood and when Well, it was already a machete because I was going to cut a stick of firewood and when I felt that he bit me, or I didn't see it that way, but when I felt something stab me and I went over there, I took two little steps when I got a really bad headache, I got drunk, I got something bad. Then I said: But so weird, a thorn was going to give me all this and I turned to look and it was already there, but it was already stuck there, it was ready again to bite me. And I wrapped it with my comb and I stabbed it. But afterwards I came away from there, I didn't want to go to the hospital and this was, well, a very nasty thing. I went dark, I couldn't see. And I arrived here at the Carmen hospital, they took me and I arrived at the Carmen and I was there at about 6:30 or 6:00.
[00:01:59.280] - Speaker 2
And you didn't know? And you don't know which snake it was?
[00:02:01.900] - Speaker 1
Yes, because I know them. It was a small thing, a small thing. And when I got there I asked myself Because after what I gave him, they came and said: It's a really big thing, they told me.
[00:02:15.370] - Speaker 2
Did you kill her on the spot?
[00:02:17.620] - Speaker 1
Of course. And then they took me to the hospital and there in the hospital. They don't tell you what's going on there in the hospital. I arrived and they sat me in a wheelchair and they put me where a virgin was and they told me to ask the Virgin of Carmen not to leave me, because there wasn't even an ambulance. That one would arrive in a while, but that there was a boy who was
[00:02:39.640] - Speaker 2
In El Carmen, in the hospital.
[00:02:40.970] - Speaker 1
That he was out of his mind and that they were going to take him away. Then, yes, they called me later. The last thing, I lost it, I didn't even know who was talking to me anymore. That was at about 7:00. They took me out of the hospital, from there to the hospital at 11:00 at night. But when they took me out, but by other gentlemen, Did you arrive at 6:30? Yes, at 6:30. And it was at 11:00 at night when I arrived. So, they took me to the spinal. And in the spinal is where they treated me. But I was hospitalized for about 15 days.
[00:03:17.660] - Speaker 2
Really? In the spine.
[00:03:20.010] - Speaker 1
In El Espinal. And in order to get out of there I had to get an injection. And it was a very expensive injection. I couldn't find one here, not in Carmen or in Girardot. They brought them to me from Bogotá. I don't even remember what those injections were called. I had a boss and he gave them to me. He sent them to me, I mean, he brought them to me from Bogotá because they weren't available here. And then I had to go for check-ups and then I didn't go anymore because I worked every day and I didn't like having to ask my bosses for permission to go home. But one day I just started, I was roasting meat, I used a heifer on Saturday, a heifer on Sunday. And one Sunday I started to skewer it and I fell asleep skewer the meat. And Don Javier came in and found me. He said to me: "Gentlemen, and he realized everything?" He was the one who was with me in the hospital and everything.
[00:04:11.602] - Speaker 1
He said to me: "Hello, did you fall asleep?" And I said: "Oh, yes, Don Javier." He said: "Didn't you go to any check-ups?" I had to go to some check-ups.
[00:04:21.110] - Speaker 1
I hadn't gone. He said: Well, I'm going to give you a free check-up. He gave me a free check-up. And I went, and that's when the doctor said to me: And you do know how snakes live? I said: Well, coiled, he said: No, not coiled. So, I said: So, how? I said: Asleep. They eat and fall asleep? Because of the poison they have, he said. I don't know. He said: And that's how you are, you have that poison. He said: Well, it's asleep, go and see. And yes, I went on Monday. I went to one check-up. I never went back. But afterwards, well, it got rid of me, it happened to me because it was a swollen foot and after they did all that to me, it went down and I was normal.
[00:05:03.290] - Speaker 2
And when you died from the snake, did you step on the snake? I stepped on it.
[00:05:13.550] - Speaker 1
I say that I stepped on her when she erased me. I'm not saying that I didn't see her, I passed by and when I did she apologized to me.
[00:05:21.400] - Speaker 2
And I'm sorry it happened, it's very bad But hey, because you got better, you get better. And I have a few more questions. Now, do you know how to prevent a snakebite?
[00:05:47.490] - Speaker 1
Well, no, here you get bitten and have to go to hospital, because there's something about someone like that
[00:05:54.890] - Speaker 2
But before a snake bite, how do you know how to avoid a snake?
[00:06:04.440] - Speaker 1
Me, to the snake that I see, so it's a poisonous one, I'm not letting it go. Yes, because one lets it go. It's like that night about eight days ago.
[00:06:15.770] - Speaker 2
There are many.
[00:06:16.720] - Speaker 1
He went to the bathroom and there was one inside.
[00:06:21.050] - Speaker 2
One stem or different?
[00:06:23.870] - Speaker 1
They are small, but that size is not bad. One that does not have the X, but rather like a little ball.
[00:06:28.870] - Speaker 2
Okay, yes.
[00:06:30.740] - Speaker 1
Yes. The little snake was always big. Yes. And here on this little line I found a red one with black.
[00:06:37.980] - Speaker 2
A what?
[00:06:39.200] - Speaker 1
A choir.
[00:06:41.710] - Speaker 2
Okay.
[00:06:42.520] - Speaker 1
No, hardly any here. The one we found here, which was in the room upstairs, was a How do you say it? A toche. It was 2.25 m. It's big. But they say those weren't there.
[00:07:03.820] - Speaker 2
And the snake bites you? Was it big too?
[00:07:09.160] - Speaker 1
It was always always big. Well, I didn't measure it. I'm still trying to measure it.
[00:07:17.990] - Speaker 2
And do you know where you are most likely to be killed by a snake? In the country or at home?
[00:07:27.990] - Speaker 1
No, to go out of the house. Although sometimes you have to be careful in the house too, but not here.
[00:07:38.960] - Speaker 2
And would you trust the hospital, the Carmen, to cure a woman? And won't you help her do it? No. And would you trust other hospitals to cure a woman?
[00:07:54.270] - Speaker 1
Of course, I was already in another hospital. Hospital. Yes. The hospital here didn't I imagined, the way I was, and if it wasn't for Don Javier who called me and told me what. As I was working and he said to me: Where are they? I was wondering what a knife. I said to him: Oh, Don Javier, I don't understand what you're telling me. I didn't quite understand what a knife. But I said to him: What are you doing? I said to him: I'm here in the hospital. I said to him: What's wrong with you? I said to him: I cut myself. And he said: What? And the hospital was being fixed and he went in through the bottom. And I couldn't see him. When he arrived I said to him: Mr. Javier, I can't see him. And how long have you been here? I said to him: Since 6:00. And he was the one who went and did something over there.
[00:08:34.911] - Speaker 1
Don Emiliano was there. And Mrs. Don Emiliano arrived and I was the one who said: I'm going to take her out, I'm going to take her in my car. But if anything happens to her, it's your fault. And then they hurried and took me out.
[00:08:48.310] - Speaker 2
And I'm sorry, who is Javier?
[00:08:51.660] - Speaker 1
He was my boss, the man I worked for.
[00:08:56.750] - Speaker 2
And can you identify six snakes? What about venomous or venomous ones?
[00:09:02.770] - Speaker 1
Very little. At least I know the one that's brave, it's the one with a very hard X, it's like ash, it's not like the other one, the other one is lighter. And the coral one too, I don't know more or less which one is the brave one. Although around here there is a red one, pure red, I don't know if that one was brave. No. Not pure red. It's the fire. It's the fire that they say it is.
[00:09:32.240] - Speaker 2
Angels are not poisonous.
[00:09:34.420] - Speaker 1
And that one that's fed up leaves it green, it's not even that it's angry. Because a relative of mine who was struggling was bitten by it. Here comes the hand and she says no. The pain passed to her. Like the guide, the guide too. That. Like it bit a dog. So there were some big ones up there coming to eat the chicken. No, I don't I say there are a lot of frogs around here. I'd rather find a snake than a frog. He says: Oh, how could I say that, I'm really scared of frogs.
[00:10:09.270] - Speaker 2
And do you know any others? And did you get bitten by a snake?
[00:10:20.490] - Speaker 1
No, when it bit me, it also bit a lady who was on the side of the road playing truant, but she did die. But like that, who knows what snake No, it wouldn't go away. No, it doesn't go away. My granddad did. My granddad, once there was a puddle and he said that he was young and all the boys came, and I: Ronald Puddle. And he says that he arrived first and he fell in and when he felt a leg, something, and he was about to get out, and when he felt on his back and when they realized, he turned to the one who had given him the puddle. And it was in the puddle. And it was a size of the brave. And maybe, you've seen so much and you're in the countryside, when we put it here, you're close to the town, or the villages, but in the countryside where you don't have And he said that the only thing he ran and queched was CPM, when it was oil, which is that he poured oil on it and they put an egg to cook, the hardest part, and then they also opened the egg and placed it there in the hottest place it could bear, and he says that was what he didn't leave.
[00:11:22.700] - Speaker 1
Because imagine, two bites. And over time, he went back and it bit his hand, he went to go and it took a lot, a finger was bitten by a snake there too. I mean, was that it? They would go to oil and they would take el borugo gel.
[00:11:40.780] - Speaker 2
And did you go to the hospital too?
[00:11:42.630] - Speaker 1
No, in the countryside he did it himself, yes.
[00:11:45.140] - Speaker 2
Did he die?
[00:11:46.980] - Speaker 1
But you see the old people, from the bite of the snake.
[00:11:51.020] - Speaker 2
And the snake bites itself, was it poisonous, a carving?
[00:12:00.430] - Speaker 1
One size.
[00:12:03.390] - Speaker 2
And for your snakebite, how did you know? The hospital is the solution. How did you know to go to the hospital after your snakebite? Do you understand me?
[00:12:31.210] - Speaker 1
No. I mean, after it bit me, how?
[00:12:34.910] - Speaker 2
How did you know it was important to go to the hospital? Because people here sometimes use condoms or other methods, but you went to the hospital.
[00:12:48.700] - Speaker 1
Yes, because the biting is already making me the only solution is to go to the hospital, because there are parts where they pray, that there are none here of They pray about them, that And the best thing for someone with that kind of pain is to run to the hospital.
[00:13:06.060] - Speaker 2
Okay, thank you. I have no more questions. Do you have anything else to say about snakes or your experiences or anything?
[00:13:17.590] - Speaker 1
No, now.
[00:13:18.570] - Speaker 2
Right? Okay. Okay, thank you very much. Okay, love. I'm sorry about the snake bite, it's very bad, but thank God you're okay.
[00:13:31.880] - Speaker 1
I was saved.
[00:13:32.950] - Speaker 2
Yes, because the lady I'm talking about, she did die.
[00:13:37.500] - Speaker 1
I remember what she was calling, she was known, that my husband had a cart. Didn't you realize? Over there. On a date? Yes, I heard, but no But she also says that her husband had already arrived drunk and left and he arrived drunk. And she in the afternoon, who cooked with firewood and went to get a stick and caught her finger. And she says that she endured that pain and that it was a very bad pain. And her husband arrived drunk and she didn't tell him to take her because he was drunk, she was scared, because she only mentioned it when they found her. A friend, I don't know who it was, went there and told her. And they took her the next day, no. The lady went there and when she went to the hospital and she went into a coma when she got to the spinal and she died. Nothing else like that.
[00:14:38.240] - Speaker 2
And you also said you went to the hospital in Bogotá too? No. No, okay, no. In Espinal, only. In Espinal, from here to Carmen, they took him for the spinal procedure. Okay. Yes. Okay, thank you very much for your time. You're welcome, you're welcome. Thank you very much.
