And how many years have you lived in El Carmen?
[00:00:26.770] - Speaker 1
Twelve years.
[00:00:30.470] - Speaker 2
And do you think it's likely that you'll be killed by a snake here?
[00:00:34.540] - Speaker 1
Out in the countryside you live in all kinds of danger, and what's more, where there are those animals, you can't be sure that you won't get bitten by one of them, because you're still out in the bush. Of course.
[00:00:54.790] - Speaker 2
And have any of your animals been bitten by a snake?
[00:01:01.450] - Speaker 1
Not in my time here.
[00:01:06.450] - Speaker 2
And do you know how to prevent or avoid a snakebite?
[00:01:11.490] - Speaker 1
Avoid it, not to make you throw up, but yes And after you get bitten, who knows. The most likely thing is that they can take you to the hospital, put you on antivenom, but what else can you do?
[00:01:29.920] - Speaker 2
And here in the house, do you have methods for avoiding snakes?
[00:01:35.770] - Speaker 1
No, ma'am. Fumigation. It is maintained by fumigating around the houses.
[00:01:40.160] - Speaker 2
And what would you do if you were bitten by a snake? One day up, that it won't kill me.
[00:01:51.070] - Speaker 1
Like I said, the main thing there is to avoid getting bitten is to make sure you're taken to a hospital quickly. That's the only one. Because after being bitten by one of those animals, and there are more than a few of them around here, yes, it's a real beast. The nearest hospital.
[00:02:08.720] - Speaker 2
The hospital in El Carmen.
[00:02:11.430] - Speaker 1
In El Carmen, that young lady.
[00:02:13.560] - Speaker 2
Would you trust the Hospital del Carmen to cure a snakebite?
[00:02:18.140] - Speaker 1
Well, I don't think so. Not in this hospital here, in El Carmen. When there are emergencies, in this area, they get serum from the base. From Tolemaida, they have serum. No, not in any hospital.
[00:02:32.520] - Speaker 2
You don't trust the Carmen hospital, but you told me, would you go to the Carmen if a snake moved?
[00:02:43.210] - Speaker 1
Yes, well, that's as close to a hospital as one is going to get.
[00:02:47.120] - Speaker 2
Would you trust other hospitals outside El Carmen?
[00:02:52.560] - Speaker 1
Yes, of course. Which ones? There is at least, if one could throw in a bad penny for Girardón, the clinic In the San Sebastián clinics, in San Rafael.
[00:03:03.140] - Speaker 2
Yes, okay. And where do you feel it is more likely that a snake will bite you? In the countryside or in the house?
[00:03:13.650] - Speaker 1
In the field. Why? Outside the field, where one works.
[00:03:19.210] - Speaker 2
Why is it more dangerous in the countryside?
[00:03:21.080] - Speaker 1
It is more likely that you will find them there than near the houses. The houses are not reached, as I say, you keep fumigating, so they are not reached, they are kept at bay.
[00:03:32.770] - Speaker 2
And can you identify poisonous snakes or non-poisonous ones? Yes, miss. What?
[00:03:39.250] - Speaker 1
That was pointed out to her by someone in the queue. The snake is now going because it has a thin tail.
[00:03:50.350] - Speaker 2
And which snakes are poisonous here?
[00:03:55.450] - Speaker 1
Poisonous here in this area is the size X. You find one here and there. I also find Agi's tail in this area. Rattlesnake, if not Suddenly, but more for the hot stuff, because not up here... Those areas, it was always talked about in this area.
[00:04:19.220] - Speaker 2
And do you know of any case of snake grinding?
[00:04:24.960] - Speaker 1
About two or three months ago, Felipe, Alejandro's administrator. He was bitten by a size X.
[00:04:36.450] - Speaker 2
And he went to the . . . ?
[00:04:40.010] - Speaker 1
They called him to the hospital and there he hit the ground running.
[00:04:43.950] - Speaker 2
And what happened? Did the bribe happen in the field?
[00:04:48.300] - Speaker 1
In the field.
[00:04:51.310] - Speaker 2
And he's OK now? Yes, he's fine. I have no more questions. Do you have more to say about snakes, more knowledge? No, I don't need you. Thank you.
[00:05:03.350] - Speaker 1
We have been so far. Yes. Without any danger from them. Yes.
[00:05:09.230] - Speaker 2
And yes, well, to die hard it's very important to go to the hospital immediately, but you know that. But thank you very much.
[00:05:23.370] - Speaker 1
With pleasure. For your time.
[00:05:24.740] - Speaker 2
Thank you.
[00:05:25.420] - Speaker 1
With pleasure.
