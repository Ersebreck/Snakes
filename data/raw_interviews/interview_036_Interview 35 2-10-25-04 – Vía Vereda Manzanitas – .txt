[00:03:25.780] - Speaker 1
First, call those who are inside the home about it. Or come earlier to the place where there is another person to avoid. And first, if you have any contact, not just one time, try to make one to avoid the course of the  Don't let the poison spread into the blood.
[00:03:52.440] - Speaker 2
And would you trust the hospital in Carmen to cure a snakebite?
[00:04:00.170] - Speaker 1
Well, not there, they brought one and they try to give you something hot so you don't get sick.
[00:04:09.820] - Speaker 2
And would you trust other hospitals outside Carmen?
[00:04:14.230] - Speaker 1

[00:04:28.710] - Speaker 1

[00:04:33.030] - Speaker 2
And can you identify poisonous snakes or non-venomous ones?
[00:04:41.510] - Speaker 1
I can't explain. It's like When we used to go there ourselves, there always, but always you avoid that, being aware of where we are going. And there on the farm when we were picking cocoa, on a cocoa tree I saw like a hug, more than one hug, a bed. So, we stood there and carried on picking the cocoa. I was nervous, yes, but So, I don't go anymore because I'm old now, and it's almost at water reserve, because I'm not loving there, so, getting a lot of food and When we were young, no, I didn't go. And as soon as we joined the ministry in '79, because that was the punishment. Blessed be the Lord who took the pensions from the ministry, the man retired. I'm fine, blessed be.
[00:05:45.760] - Speaker 2
And when your brother bit a snake, was it in the countryside?
[00:05:56.100] - Speaker 1

Well, I don't have any more questions, but do you have more to say about snakes or more knowledge.
[00:06:39.300] - Speaker 1
Yes, the care is when walking, no, no. Yes. It is far away, you go there, you have to go with your comb or your stick to keep it away. And now, as I don't leave the house, I'm going to say: What's around here?
[00:06:54.320] - Speaker 2
And also for snake bites, it is not advisable to apply a tourniquet, because the blood needs to circulate more. It is not advisable to apply a tourniquet and it is advisable to go to the hospital immediately for antivenom.
[00:07:24.580] - Speaker 1
Yes, it's true. You even come here and try to suck the poison out of life. Yes, exactly. Because they say it's like sucking the poison from a snake.
