Six months?
[00:00:52.900] - Speaker 1
I'm from Tolima, but I've been here for six months. Okay, good.
[00:00:59.070] - Speaker 2
So, do you think it's likely that you'll be bitten by a snake here?
[00:01:04.400] - Speaker 1
Yes, of course.
[00:01:06.780] - Speaker 2
Why?
[00:01:07.960] - Speaker 1
Because there are plenty of snakes here, so you can't be Assured, except that at some point a snake might bite you.
[00:01:19.020] - Speaker 2
Yes, okay. And have any of your animals been bitten by a snake? No, none. And do you know how to prevent a snakebite?
[00:01:33.760] - Speaker 1
No, not really.
[00:01:34.420] - Speaker 2
And how did you prevent it? No. And what would you do if you were bitten by a snake?
[00:01:44.500] - Speaker 1
Well, the first thing I would do would be to run to the village, to look for the hospital, that would be the first thing I would do.
[00:01:51.240] - Speaker 2
Yes.
[00:01:52.760] - Speaker 3
Ask for help. Yes, of course, at the hospital or something, because what else?
[00:01:56.950] - Speaker 1
It would be the first thing one would do around here, go to the village, the only thing.
[00:02:00.240] - Speaker 3
And as we have found each other, one is already
[00:02:06.250] - Speaker 2
And would you go to the El Carmen hospital? Yes, of course. Would you trust the hospital, the El Carmen, to cure a snake bite?
[00:02:16.960] - Speaker 1
Well, like in the story, given the circumstances, it's up to you to trust. Because yes, the first thing would be to get there at the hospital and they would arrange or transfer you to the other place where they do have the antidote to prevent amordebre.
[00:02:35.410] - Speaker 2
And do you know of any other hospitals that are also outside, Carmen, but close to the Carmen? But close to the Carmen.
[00:02:41.300] - Speaker 1
I think Gilardo. Gilardo, okay. Gilardo.
[00:02:45.360] - Speaker 2
And where do you feel it is more likely that a snake will bite you? In the house or in the countryside?
[00:02:54.810] - Speaker 1
Anywhere, because they sometimes come in the house and in the field too. You're not sure if one of them might bite you at any moment.
[00:03:09.090] - Speaker 2
And can you identify poisonous snakes or non-venomous ones?
[00:03:14.060] - Speaker 1
Yes, I do.
[00:03:15.800] - Speaker 2
How can snakes identify each other?
[00:03:19.180] - Speaker 1
Well, now, as this is like, let's say, the size, normally you know the size one. And now there are other ways of identifying them, because you can go on Google with your cell phone and you take a photo and it identifies it itself. So, there are many ways to find out what kind of snake or animal it is. With the cell phone you take a photo of it and the information comes up. Well, I do it. Well, with the one I live with today I had my doubts, but then when I put the cell phone on it, I called. Was it another one?
[00:03:58.850] - Speaker 2
Yes, exactly. I blew it up here, yes.
[00:04:01.440] - Speaker 1
That's what came out. And poisonous and everything, and of such and such a kind, all that comes out to one of Well, there are several varieties, aren't there? Yes. But here more than anything, that's the one.
[00:04:13.110] - Speaker 2
Yes. And do you know what other poisonous snakes there are here?
[00:04:19.740] - Speaker 1
Well, that's all I've seen. Now, that's all we've seen. I haven't seen any more of those. I haven't seen any more. Well, the man says there's a tailpiece and a choir, but I haven't seen them. I haven't seen them here. But yes, maybe there are. Maybe there are fewer.
[00:04:38.070] - Speaker 3
But yes, we found that size the other day. What size? Which one? Granadilla.
[00:04:43.390] - Speaker 1
But that's not it. She says no, but we've seen it. There's also granadilla, one they call granadilla, but that's not it It's brave, but it's not... Poisonous. It's not poisonous.
[00:04:53.830] - Speaker 2
And do they know of any cases of snakebite?
[00:05:00.560] - Speaker 1
Nearby, I heard a man who was bitten once and I think they moved quickly and if not, I think that the man where they didn't give it quickly, would have died from the colleague's bite. That was just last year.
[00:05:18.320] - Speaker 2
And do you know anything about the bite that happened in the field?
[00:05:23.700] - Speaker 1
I think so. I think so, it was on the estate.
[00:05:28.040] - Speaker 2
And yes, I have no more questions. Do you have anything else to say about your experiences with snakes or your knowledge about snakes?
[00:05:43.980] - Speaker 1
Knowledge, yes. I know several, but when it comes to a bite, a sting, I wouldn't know how to treat it in the moment.
[00:05:54.120] - Speaker 2
Yes, to avoid snake bites it's a bit difficult because there are a lot of snakes here, but at night it's important to have a light and it's important to look carefully. And in the house too, snakes like a lot of rubbish, it's important to clean the house. And yes, in the countryside it's important to wear boots and trousers too, but as Tulio said, big snakes, adults, can die from your trousers in your boots too. And the most important knowledge or information is if you have a snake bite and need to go to the hospital immediately. And the hospital in El Carmen is not up to standard with antivenoms for snake bites. It's better to go to Espinal, Giradur and Balgue, other larger hospitals outside El Carmen. And it's important not to use a tourniquet either, because the blood needs to circulate. And other methods don't work. The antidote is the only solution, yes. If you are bitten by a snake, it is important to go to the hospital immediately. And yes, yes, that is the information.
[00:08:03.543] - Speaker 2
Is there more research into preventing snake bites or dying from snake bites?
[00:08:14.890] - Speaker 1
No, let yourself be bitten. I go out, I keep my eyes open and I tell the girl around.
[00:08:21.890] - Speaker 3
Because if at the moment, before you are bitten by an insect, I don't tell you to wait, but to start running, because there is nothing else to do at the moment. That prevention.
[00:08:31.360] - Speaker 1
Yes, to keep you guessing about where they are. But sometimes they're hidden. I didn't tell you that this morning when I was standing on it and I hadn't realized, the stick like this, as it was at the foot of a tile, my foot was like that. When I looked, I was stepping on the stick and she was there underneath. But she was tiny, she was like this. But she was one size.
[00:08:55.980] - Speaker 2
And there she was, curled up there, still. There are many sizes here. Here and there. Many, many, many.
[00:09:07.370] - Speaker 1
Be careful. They say there are big ones, but I haven't seen any big ones. I've seen three, but they were small.
[00:09:13.960] - Speaker 2
But there is.
[00:09:14.720] - Speaker 1
But there are. They say there are some very big ones. Yes, when it's your turn, it's best to be very careful where you walk.
[00:09:24.200] - Speaker 2
Exactly.
[00:09:24.320] - Speaker 1
It was killed by a cat, a small little cat. A cat killed it.
[00:09:30.770] - Speaker 2
Yes.
