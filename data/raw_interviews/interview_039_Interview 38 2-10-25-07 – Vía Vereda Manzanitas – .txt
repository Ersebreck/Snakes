[00:00:38.400] - Speaker 1
The odds are yes, but let's say no, because imagine, in today's shitty world, he can't stand the other guy.

[00:01:26.090] - Speaker 2
Which doctor? Which hospital?
[00:01:28.470] - Speaker 1
To the hospital, El Carmen. El Carmen?
[00:01:30.820] - Speaker 2
And would you trust the hospital in Carmen to cure a snake bite?
[00:01:37.030] - Speaker 1
Well, let's say yes, of course, because where I come from there are lots of quack healers that you ask for a Then, just like that, they cure you.
[00:01:47.600] - Speaker 2
Would you also trust other hospitals outside, near Carmen?
[00:01:54.150] - Speaker 1
Yes, of course.
[00:01:55.550] - Speaker 2
And where do you feel it is more likely to bite you, in the country or at home?
[00:02:09.020] - Speaker 1
Look, it's weird, because I find the schoolgirl busier at home than in the bush. It's easier for one to go out the door and find her there. On the other hand, one in the bush, almost very little.
[00:02:25.090] - Speaker 2
Can you identify poisonous and non-poisonous snakes?
[00:02:30.670] - Speaker 1

[00:02:36.330] - Speaker 1

[00:02:46.230] - Speaker 2
Yes, which snakes here are poisonous?
[00:02:48.060] - Speaker 1
The ones called X and the other one is what? The Corale? Yes. Something like that.
[00:02:58.090] - Speaker 2
And the Stonewomen too. And do you know of a case of a black snake helping a woman?
[00:03:06.940] - Speaker 1
When I was on the coast, yes, many cases. Here almost none. But I didn't see how that process went, yes. On the other hand, there I did see two guys who got stung.
[00:03:18.960] - Speaker 2
Where on the coast?
[00:03:21.060] - Speaker 1
In Córdoba. Where? Córdoba.
[00:03:26.090] - Speaker 2
And I have no more questions. Do you have more to say about snakes or your experiences?
[00:03:34.600] - Speaker 1
No. Not much experience with snakes. Yes. Well, once when I was young, I got a fright. Yes, of course. They sent me a big one, a bit like from here, from here to the door. We're going to fall about five meters across Tulio.
[00:03:52.080] - Speaker 2
Was it a size?
[00:03:53.410] - Speaker 1
Three sizes. Three sizes. But it was thick and my feet went through, like this. I arrived, I was working on a farm. I arrived at the farm that I arrived yellow, white, I black, I was white, man. And that, I was throwing up and everything. The shock, I think I was scared, what else? The lady told me: It could be that the hill stung you. No, it didn't sting me. I was throwing up. They gave me half, but that's great. I was out of it, I was about 15 years old.
[00:04:19.570] - Speaker 2
That's the only thing. In this house, here. No, there. On another property.
[00:04:25.650] - Speaker 1
On the coast, like me.
[00:04:27.130] - Speaker 2
On the coast.
[00:04:28.530] - Speaker 1
In And also for snakebites it is important to go to the right hospital after a snakebite AND because hospital antidotes are the only solutions for snakebites. Yes, of course.
[00:04:58.320] - Speaker 2
And don't make toniquetes, those are bad. And the hospital in Carmen doesn't usually have the antidote. The hospitals in Gilado Espinal and Baguet do. But that's it. Thank you very much for your time. You're welcome.
