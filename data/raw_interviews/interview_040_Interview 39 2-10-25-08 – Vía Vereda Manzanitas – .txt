[00:00:11.590] - Speaker 2
Are you married or single?
[00:00:13.790] - Speaker 1
In a common-law relationship.
[00:00:15.340] - Speaker 2
And how many years have you lived in Carmen?
[00:00:19.230] - Speaker 1
One year and three months.
[00:00:24.400] - Speaker 2
So, do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:30.080] - Speaker 1
Sure, here and anywhere else.
[00:00:32.860] - Speaker 2
Yes. And why is that?
[00:00:36.170] - Speaker 1
Well, because everything outside the city, and even in the city, animals always wander around, by instinct. Maybe even more here, because it's humid, it's warm, and there are a lot of forests, which is where they live most. Exactly, yes. The danger is finding them and stepping on them, not seeing them and stepping on them.
[00:01:00.080] - Speaker 2
And have any of your animals ever been bitten by a snake?
[00:01:07.510] - Speaker 1
No, not that I know of.
[00:01:09.790] - Speaker 2
And do you know how to prevent a snake bite?
[00:01:14.960] - Speaker 1
Let's see, what should I tell them? The only thing I know is that if one bites you, I mean, if I notice it and I know the animal, I know its name, with the name, I can go, I can get transportation in an instant and go to the hospital and they'll give you the anti-venom serum. That's all I know about it. Knowledge, right? But the rest Because there are many who say that if you get bitten by a snake, you should cut it, squeeze it, get the poison out, and I don't know what else, but the truth is I've never done it and I've never seen it done.
[00:01:58.630] - Speaker 2
And before a snake bite, do you know how to avoid snakes or prevent snake bites?
[00:02:10.290] - Speaker 1
Well, my grandparents used to tell me that to keep an animal, like a snake, from coming near you, you had to Tobacco, they say that tobacco scares them away, I don't know what. There are many superstitions. Others say that when that happens, you sprinkle sulfur around the house and that will keep them away. That's what I've heard, but I've never tried it, so I don't know if it works.
[00:02:46.380] - Speaker 2
And what would you do if a snake bit you?
[00:02:52.010] - Speaker 1
What would you do if a snake bit you? Well, probably the first thing to do, what they say you should do, is to stop the poison from spreading. Let's say it bit you on the foot, then you have to make a bandage, not too tight. And if you have a means of transportation, get someone to take you to a doctor, because a snake bite is complicated. You can't treat it yourself, and neither can anyone else. So you have to go to the doctor.
[00:03:27.420] - Speaker 2
And which doctor? In El Carmen?
[00:03:30.310] - Speaker 1
In El Carmen, to the hospital.
[00:03:32.540] - Speaker 2
And would you trust the hospital in Carmen to treat a snake bite?
[00:03:39.190] - Speaker 1
Well, presumably because they have antivenom. They have to have antivenom, don't they? There isn't any in Carmen.
[00:03:45.920] - Speaker 2
No, there isn't. There isn't.
[00:03:48.720] - Speaker 1
So, you die. You die there because here, here, let me tell you: And the worst thing is that snake bites are not all the same. Because, for example, the most ferocious snake I've ever seen in Ferocious, ferocious, the rattlesnake. The one that makes...
[00:04:13.310] - Speaker 2
That one, that one is very fierce.
[00:04:14.340] - Speaker 1
It bites you and itches, and you leave it for half an hour. In half an hour, whatever you can walk and see, after half an hour, the light goes out of your eyes and you can no longer see. The first thing it attacks is And it attacks your heart little by little, it attacks you little by little, but your vision goes away. Because I saw a man who was bitten here in Tolemaida, I was working in Tolemaida, and the man came to do a... He came to... He was, I don't know, he came from another country and came to see if there were rattles in Tolemaida, and they told him, "There are some here." And he asked for an authorized permit and they signed it and he went in to look for something, I don't know what, and damn it, he was looking and looking, and he was looking, and then he found one and bit it. And he managed to walk for half an hour. He says he managed to walk for half an hour.
[00:05:11.447] - Speaker 1
And he arrived and left and he was shouting there, he said: "I couldn't see, the light went out," he said: "I couldn't see anything, nothing, nothing, nothing, dark, dark, dark."
[00:05:23.520] - Speaker 1
He said: And I shouted: Help, help me, help me, a snake bit me. He said: A soldier, what happened? Or whoever heard me. And he said: What happened? No, a snake bit me, a snake bit me. What kind of snake? A rattlesnake. He said, 'Get it out of me quickly, I need to be taken to the clinic. They took him out in a car, put him in and drove him away. There they gave him antivenom and after a moment he started vomiting, which was to get the poison out. I mean, I kind of understand that. But like I said, if you get bitten, that's it. I don't know what they told him, that you need a bandage and this and that, but the poison will keep flowing because it goes straight into the bloodstream.
[00:06:11.550] - Speaker 2
And well, do you also trust the other hospitals around Carmen to treat the dying?
[00:06:24.970] - Speaker 1
Let's say that in this case, as far as I know, he's the only one who would do it, because I know he played the hero in Enteofílico, on the way there, I would trust him. I don't know if they have him in Melgar or maybe in Girardot. The problem is that, as we're talking here, it's the following. The problem is that maybe here in Carmen there aren't any, because they say: No, around here, snakes don't bite. And here, if it bites you, it's because you're bothering it. And often they don't know that there are people here and they should know, because it's very important.
[00:07:04.080] - Speaker 2
And yes, where do you feel you are more likely to be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:07:13.110] - Speaker 1
Possibilities. And equal ones. They can be equal. Because in the countryside, if you go out and walk and suddenly you don't see it and it bites you. At home, sometimes they come in, because we've killed them there in the house. I've already killed them practically to get into the room. And it's pure carving. I've killed them there. Where I am now, I've already killed about six or seven. Even though I always have them and I burn the trash, I burn tires, they say that with the tire, the smoke from the tire runs and I don't know what else. There are so many things they tell you. You also fumigate, sometimes you fumigate to clean, because the cleaner it is, the less the animal is around, because it lives in the humidity, on the ground, in the dirt, the leaves. That's where they hide the most, among the leaves.
[00:08:14.150] - Speaker 2
Do you know how to identify poisonous snakes or venomous snakes? Yes. How do you identify them?
[00:08:22.150] - Speaker 1
By their color. By their color, and they can also be identified. Often, you can identify a fierce snake by its head.
[00:08:40.900] - Speaker 2
Do you know of any other cases of snake bites?
[00:08:46.040] - Speaker 1
No.
[00:08:46.630] - Speaker 2
No, okay. Well, I don't have any more questions. Do you have anything else to say about snakes or your experiences?
[00:08:55.590] - Speaker 1
No, I was going to ask you. You tell me that if I were suddenly bitten by a snake, what would I do, right? Well, I'm asking you. In this case, what would you advise me to do? What point would you give me to tell me: Do this, do that? So, I'm asking you: Would you tell me what to do? Let's say it bit me. Let's say that in this case I'm lying down and it came and bang. Because of that, it bit me here. What do I do there? What am I going to do?
[00:09:27.760] - Speaker 2
It is important to go to the hospital immediately. The hospital in Carmen does not have the antidote, but it is possible. You need to go to the hospital in Carmen for a Refer.
[00:09:52.270] - Speaker 1
Forward.
[00:09:52.810] - Speaker 2
Refer, referrals. Referrals, yes.
[00:09:54.440] - Speaker 1
Wherever you have them. Yes.
[00:09:56.680] - Speaker 2
But the hospital is in Melgar y Baguet, Girardot, Espinal. They have the antroids.
[00:10:05.530] - Speaker 1
You can keep them there.
[00:10:06.840] - Speaker 2
Yes. And tourniquets are also bad because they prevent blood from circulating in your body. Don't use a tourniquet, just go straight to the hospital.
[00:10:30.280] - Speaker 1
Yes, suggestions.
[00:10:34.280] - Speaker 2
Yes. Well, ready? Anything else to say? No. Okay. Thank you very much. Okay.
