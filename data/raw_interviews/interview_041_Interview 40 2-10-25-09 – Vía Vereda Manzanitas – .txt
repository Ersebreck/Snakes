And do you think it's likely that you'll be killed by a snake here?
[00:00:38.380] - Speaker 2
Of course we do. Why? We all take risks, because this is the countryside and this is where it is. Exactly, yes. They got in here, they got in the house, they got in me, red snakes.

What day? About eight days ago. It says: "My husband killed one over there on the long side." I don't know what kind of snake it was, but it was between the shuffleboard court, all colored, very small. Since I don't know them, I don't know what kind.

And do you know how to prevent or avoid a snakebite?
[00:01:30.850] - Speaker 2
No, ma'am.
[00:01:31.740] - Speaker 1
And what would you do if you were bitten by a snake?
[00:01:40.310] - Speaker 2
What would we do? Imagine. With this hospital, here in Carmen, what not That's a health center. They don't treat you there, I mean, you have to be referred there, otherwise you'll die. Because, let me tell you, that hospital if not...
[00:02:05.080] - Speaker 1
Would you trust the hospital, Carmen, to cure a snakebite?
[00:02:09.390] - Speaker 2
No, ma'am.
[00:02:10.790] - Speaker 1
And would you trust other nearby hospitals, Carmen?
[00:02:16.110] - Speaker 2
Yes, ma'am. Why? Because here in El Carmen, first of all, there's no antidote for that. So, from there you go and from there they refer you until when you're already on the spinal. On the spinal yes, there is already an antidote and I think in Girardón too. And where do you feel it's most likely that a snake will bite you?
[00:02:43.430] - Speaker 1
In the field or at home or?
[00:02:48.130] - Speaker 2
In the field, over there. Why? Because over there is very likely because snakes spend it like on the banks of When it is summer, on the banks of the wells there are some that are covered. Down there we found one that we put on top of that animal. Looking. Covered with leaves. And we placed it. We were bringing in manure and we had it under the sack, but it was a big snake, I don't know what it's called. That's why it's more dangerous. Me, for going out there. I'm really scared. Yes, I'm really scared of snakes and I'm scared of it.
[00:03:39.760] - Speaker 1
And do you know how to identify yourself snake, are you venomous or not? And do you know? Not much.
[00:03:47.110] - Speaker 2
No, ma'am. Okay.
[00:03:49.270] - Speaker 1
And do you know of any cases of snakebite?
[00:03:55.810] - Speaker 2
Over here, yes. I mean, over there a man who lives over there, you already know him. He was bitten by a snake and he had, but to go to the  And the other one that bit Luz Mila, his wife too, was bitten by a snake.
[00:04:14.230] - Speaker 1
Were the other cases in the field or in the field path?
[00:04:23.870] - Speaker 2
Here in the field, yes, ma'am, over there.
[00:04:26.410] - Speaker 1
In the house?
[00:04:28.230] - Speaker 2
No, ma'am, in the field. On the road, because it bit Ramón on the way. You tell me that it kills Borujo so much when it goes out to get its fill. Can we get that? That's the counter. Borujo's milk.
[00:04:46.560] - Speaker 1
And I have no more questions. Do you have anything more to say about snakes or your experiences with them?
[00:04:55.850] - Speaker 2
No, ma'am.
[00:04:57.150] - Speaker 1
Okay, good. Thank you.
[00:04:58.930] - Speaker 2
Yes, ma'am. And the important information is that if you do bite a snake, go to the hospital right away.
[00:05:10.810] - Speaker 1
And the hospital in Alcalde doesn't have antidotes, but in spinal twister, mergar, there are.
[00:05:20.630] - Speaker 2
Yes, ma'am.
[00:05:22.630] - Speaker 1
And people think that fainting is a good way to get some privacy, but fainting is not a good thing. The blood needs to circulate in your body, don't faint. Hey, you hear.
[00:05:44.590] - Speaker 2
No. There are people who say that they tie themselves up so that the poison doesn't circulate and they cut themselves first so that the blood comes out.
[00:05:56.710] - Speaker 1
Yes, it's bad, because if you make a tourniquet, the poison stays in one place and that's very bad for that place in your body.
[00:06:10.450] - Speaker 2
Of course.
[00:06:11.460] - Speaker 1
And yes.
[00:06:13.770] - Speaker 2
In other words, not that Until I go to the hospital.
[00:06:21.630] - Speaker 1
Yes, exactly.
[00:06:24.010] - Speaker 2
Yes, ma'am.
[00:06:25.430] - Speaker 1
Okay, thank you very much.
[00:06:26.900] - Speaker 2
There you go. Well, madam, no madam, you're very welcome.
