[00:00:00.970] - Speaker 2
Here there is, on this estate, nothing at all. Yes, of course. That's why it's close to the two streams. Yes, of course. I mean, there's a ravine there and there's the other one over there, the other river. So, over there there's
[00:00:10.640] - Speaker 1
Tall or short?
[00:00:13.530] - Speaker 2
They are size X.
[00:00:16.270] - Speaker 1
There is also red. Corals.
[00:00:19.130] - Speaker 2
There's the Choral. But there's also the other one, the one we call the bejuca, the green one. Over there, it hides in the trees. That one is not poisonous, but And there's also the egg, the egg. The mitao. The mitao, we call it mitao, which is the same silly.
[00:00:41.240] - Speaker 1
Yes.
[00:00:43.100] - Speaker 4
Haven't you studied that public health study about how people prevent snakebites?
[00:00:53.140] - Speaker 1
I don't study snakes exactly, but yes. And which one? What's your name?
[00:01:00.590] - Speaker 2
Roberto.
[00:01:01.380] - Speaker 1
And how old are you?
[00:01:04.220] - Speaker 2
I am 57 years old.
[00:01:06.230] - Speaker 1
And what do you do for work? If you work.
[00:01:08.940] - Speaker 2
I'm a teacher. Of course, a teacher now.
[00:01:11.670] - Speaker 1
And are you married or single?
[00:01:14.830] - Speaker 2
Married. Living together.
[00:01:16.720] - Speaker 1
And do you have children?
[00:01:18.910] - Speaker 2
I have two children.
[00:01:20.400] - Speaker 1
And how many years have you lived in El Carmen?
[00:01:23.830] - Speaker 2
All my life. I've lived here in Carmen all my life because I'm from here.
[00:01:27.930] - Speaker 1
Well, yes. And do you think it's likely that you'll be bitten by a snake here? Yes, of course.
[00:01:35.380] - Speaker 2
Why? Because in any case you don't know what's out there, you could be clearing the undergrowth or whatever, and suddenly you step on a snake and it bites you. Of course, it could bite you at any moment. You can't rule that out, a snake could kill you at any moment. Of course. Yes.
[00:01:56.470] - Speaker 1
And have any of your animals been bitten by a snake?
[00:02:01.880] - Speaker 2
Has any animal of mine ever been bitten? No, no animal has ever been bitten by a snake.
[00:02:07.510] - Speaker 1
And do you know how to prevent or avoid a snakebite?
[00:02:12.480] - Speaker 2
No, you're not prepared for that.
[00:02:14.960] - Speaker 1
And what would you do if you were bitten by a snake?
[00:02:20.620] - Speaker 2
If I was bitten by a snake, the first thing I'd do is cut myself with the gilet to see if it drew a little blood there while I was at it. But one, I mean, one. Right? No. No? What? They can hardly carry the snake. And how are they going to eat it? What if one bites you and you can't catch it, what then? Well, I think the first thing one does is get scared.
[00:02:45.500] - Speaker 3
I think that if you're scared, the first thing you do is kill the snake, kill it, because what a bad thing.
[00:02:52.070] - Speaker 2
But what you should do is, like with a wound, rajachi, and draw a little blood, at least what you can, to see if at least it's poison, right? That's for sure.
[00:03:02.080] - Speaker 4
There's a machete blow that
[00:03:04.230] - Speaker 2
The poison it has in store. And one of nerves, I don't think you even want to catch the snake. How are you going to catch it?
[00:03:15.930] - Speaker 1
Yes, okay. And what else? Is there more? Methods before a After a snakebite or not?
[00:03:29.940] - Speaker 2
Well, no, the only methods that one can see there are that, because what else, nothing more, because anyway, if one is bitten by a snake, the first thing that one is left with is like not knowing what to do. Right? Because neither catch it, because if one is going to catch it, one is more afraid.
[00:03:47.940] - Speaker 3
It doesn't make women look good.
[00:03:52.290] - Speaker 2
Well, you would think that if you are bitten, the first thing you have to do is to seek first aid, because also if time passes, the more likely it is that you will die. The sooner you get to the doctor, the more likely it is that you will be saved, the person who has the forms of And would you trust the hospital, the Carmen, to cure a snakebite? Well, I don't think so. Why? Because the Hospital del Carmen doesn't have the capacity for that. Does it? No, it doesn't. Yes, the capacity. It doesn't have the capacity there for It doesn't have the serum they need or the things they need for a snakebite.
[00:04:41.680] - Speaker 1
And would you trust other hospitals to cure a snakebite?
[00:04:47.570] - Speaker 2
Yes, there are good hospitals in Gilatoy and in El Espinal too, in Ibagué. But in Gilatoy there are good clinics, good first-aid posts.
[00:04:56.510] - Speaker 1
And where do you feel it is more likely that a snake will bite you? In the countryside or at home?
[00:05:03.900] - Speaker 2
No, in the field. I mean, at least on this farm you can stick a snake anywhere, because you're around the bushes, at least you cut the bush, the cinglas and that, and they can be down there. At any moment an animal could bite you because you don't look where the leaves are so much. So, maybe yes, not in the house. Not in the house, because in the house we fumigate with poison. That is, we always fumigate in the surrounding area with poison that keeps away all insects and animals.
[00:05:31.760] - Speaker 1
Yes, okay. And can you identify poisonous snakes from non-poisonous ones?
[00:05:38.970] - Speaker 2
Well, yes, I can distinguish several snakes that are kind of poisonous.
[00:05:43.010] - Speaker 1
And how can snakes identify themselves?
[00:05:46.450] - Speaker 2
The size X is a snake that we identify well, because it has some things like a cross, which are colored. The other one that is very venerable is the one that moves its tail, what is it called? The one that makes the bell rattle. It is also very venerable, but the rattlesnake is well known because it has a little thing like that on its tail and it always makes it rattle. There are also some that are hunters, they are not poisonous and they see you and kind of run away. There is also the güigo, what we call the lower midland. Here there is also a very poisonous snake. And the rattlesnake, maybe the rattlesnake too, but the rattlesnake is a snake that is dangerous.
[00:06:39.020] - Speaker 1
Yes, exactly.
[00:06:40.160] - Speaker 2
It keeps a lot in the trees. It stings, but it also bites and is poisonous. And the coral, but the coral hardly ever bites you, does it?
[00:06:49.050] - Speaker 4
Yes.
[00:06:49.780] - Speaker 2
Really? It bites too? And it's poisonous.
[00:06:54.820] - Speaker 3
No, not me. They bite you and they're not going to leave you halfway.
[00:07:00.610] - Speaker 2
But the coral almost never coils. In other words, how can the coral move if it doesn't?
[00:07:08.350] - Speaker 1
Yes, and they hide more.
[00:07:11.120] - Speaker 2
They hide, but they don't get away like that. You always see them stretched out, is that it?
[00:07:19.290] - Speaker 1
And do you know of a case of a snake bite? My sister, Luzmila, was bitten.
[00:07:29.080] - Speaker 2
But I have also heard of other cases, that is, other cases of people who have bitten snakes.
[00:07:34.320] - Speaker 1
Yes. Is Luz Mena your sister?
[00:07:36.640] - Speaker 2
Luzmila, yes. My sister. And I also know Ramón Romero, who was bitten by one up there too, a big one. A rotten one. A rotten one. The task of the tavenida lasted a long time sick and it came out on his body, it lasted a while that warts came out on his body after the poison. They cured him and then he started to get some kind of illness in his body. Sure The woman too, but that's also in the natural court. Also, right?
[00:08:04.150] - Speaker 1
And he went to the hospital, in El Carmen?
[00:08:07.670] - Speaker 2
To the hospital, but they never go to Carmen. They go to Carmen as a first port of call, but from there it refers them elsewhere. Because in Carmen's hospital, they don't have anything there. Of course. There's nothing there. Of course. We've said, that hospital, needless to say, you go there as if in passing.
[00:08:24.640] - Speaker 1
Yes.
[00:08:25.860] - Speaker 3
Uh-huh, I saw a snake bite a cow.
[00:08:31.050] - Speaker 1
Here?
[00:08:34.860] - Speaker 3
And his tail fell off.
[00:08:37.930] - Speaker 2
Here, on this little farm, it struck at the back of this little farm. It killed him because they put him in treatment. The snake killed him, two cows that still They put it in treatment. Recently. Over there, the one that was nothing. Here with Juan's, in Juan Herrana's. Here, adjoining this farm, here by the side of that little farm, over there, tall, well-built. Who hasn't, an Alberto? An Alberto, the snake killed two cows.
[00:09:03.520] - Speaker 1
I have no more questions, but you have more to say about snakes or your experiences with snakes.
[00:09:12.610] - Speaker 2
No, but I have seen many snakes, many.
[00:09:15.190] - Speaker 1
Yes, there are lots of them. There are lots of them, yes.
[00:09:17.530] - Speaker 2
There are many, but not all of them are venerable. There are some that you look at and they just look at you, because they also see you the same as any animal. They see you from a distance, at least the hunters see you from a distance and they  Tell me, to leave at once they come out. Or they stand still for a moment and they start and they go.
[00:09:34.670] - Speaker 4
When they had the chibos, which I was going to feed to the one that was tied up, one day I almost put a paw on one of them. And I was going to walk, I'm going to say walking and I was putting my foot down and it turned around and I did look at me with those eyes, round. I screamed and the animal came out.
[00:09:52.500] - Speaker 2
And I don't like science.
[00:09:56.860] - Speaker 1
How scary, yes.
[00:09:59.760] - Speaker 2
He has, what's it called? A phobia. A phobia. Of snakes. But not me. I like to see them.
[00:10:12.530] - Speaker 1
Me too, yes, but they're dangerous.
[00:10:15.820] - Speaker 2
But I do like to see them. They are dangerous, but also if you bother them.
[00:10:19.220] - Speaker 1
Yes, they are pretty too. I like to look at them.
[00:10:22.500] - Speaker 2
They're nice, yes. Aren't they? They're nice, they're not that ugly, but what it comes down to is
[00:10:28.220] - Speaker 1
And yes, And it's important to know that if you kill a snake, you need to go to the right hospital. And don't make a tourniquet and And yes, it's important to go to the right hospital immediately.
[00:10:54.180] - Speaker 2
As soon as he gets bitten, let's take him to the hospital. Do nothing, neither catch the snake nor do anything. Why would anyone want to catch the snake with such a bad pain, scared? But they'll follow it there. Yes? But At least a photo.
[00:11:10.420] - Speaker 1
Yes, a photo haunts her, yes.
[00:11:14.180] - Speaker 2
No, thank you. Would you like a little vasoline for it? The plant has some. Are you going to be doing that for a while? For a little while. If you like, I can get some for you. The plant has some. You're recording it, aren't you?
[00:11:32.120] - Speaker 1
Hi. Hi, how are you? Good, and you? Yes, it's necessary to know which snake is biting which.
[00:11:46.540] - Speaker 2
Give me the homalada. No, no, no. It's like this when both of them. Excuse me. Go on. But the thing that always bites you here is the size. Yes, almost. Here I don't see a snake that bites you like this. As far as I know, the thing that always bites you. It's the size, isn't it, Tulio? The little size. Yes, the little size. It's the little size that always bites you and it's the one that everyone is afraid of because it's a very poisonous snake and it's a snake that doesn't shy away from anything. That is, no, no. No, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, it doesn't walk, it doesn't walk fast. And apart from the fact that if you disturb it, if you move it just a little bit, it will go away, but it will come back very close, but to bite you. That's not going to scare her away, nothing will, not even because they're going to kill her, because the snake, you're working with the snake and you catch it and you get it tangled up in the snake and if you don't do anything to it, she's there, just waiting.
[00:12:35.667] - Speaker 2
Let's see if you can promote it. It's a very The size is very dangerous, it's a dangerous snake for everyone.
[00:12:41.060] - Speaker 1
Yes, yes. She's a fighter.
[00:12:44.960] - Speaker 3
But there are no snakes here, three-headed. There are snakes in the oceans.
[00:12:53.930] - Speaker 2
Does it have fuel in there?
[00:12:55.440] - Speaker 3
It has three heads.
[00:12:57.780] - Speaker 1
Also, yes.
[00:12:59.120] - Speaker 2
Don't you want to hold it? No.
[00:13:01.650] - Speaker 1
Thank you very much. That's it.
