My name is Josefina Espejo.

And how old are you?
[00:00:07.570] - Speaker 2

And what do you do for work? If you work?
[00:00:11.870] - Speaker 2
No, I spend all my time here in the house.
[00:00:14.620] - Speaker 1
And are you married or single?
[00:00:16.820] - Speaker 2
Free union.
[00:00:18.180] - Speaker 1
And how many children do you have? If you have children? Four. And how many years have you lived in El Carmen?
[00:00:30.580] - Speaker 2
Thirty-two years.
[00:00:33.860] - Speaker 1
So, do you think it's likely that you'll be bitten by a snake here, in El Carmen?
[00:00:40.260] - Speaker 2
Well, yes.
[00:00:41.680] - Speaker 1
Why?
[00:00:43.190] - Speaker 2
Because there have been fires in the surrounding area, so the animals have come down from the mountains. And then here on this side there is more vegetation, it hasn't been burnt, so the animals migrate. Of course.
[00:01:02.750] - Speaker 1
And have any of your animals been bitten by a snake?
[00:01:08.350] - Speaker 2
No. No? Well. No, not here.
[00:01:11.320] - Speaker 1
And do you know how to prevent or avoid a snakebite?
[00:01:16.230] - Speaker 2
One always goes to the hospital to get anti-venom, right?
[00:01:24.670] - Speaker 1
Yes, of course. And before a snake bite, do you know how to avoid a snake?
[00:01:32.560] - Speaker 2
To make the link, to tie it or not, I don't know.
[00:01:39.110] - Speaker 1
And what would you do if you were bitten by a snake?
[00:01:43.240] - Speaker 2
Do the ligation, yes, and run to the doctor.
[00:01:48.670] - Speaker 1
And would you trust the hospital, the Carmen, to cure a snakebite?
[00:01:54.850] - Speaker 2
They have almost always helped people there, there in El Carmen.
[00:02:00.220] - Speaker 1
And would you trust other hospitals too, near the Hospital del Carmen?
[00:02:07.750] - Speaker 2
Well, Melgar is close by and so is Girardot.
[00:02:11.510] - Speaker 1
And would you trust Girardot and Melgar to cure a snakebite? Yes. And where do you feel it is most likely that a snake will bite you? In the countryside or at home?
[00:02:27.140] - Speaker 2
When it's getting very, very hot, they come into the house. So you always have to be careful to make sure they don't come in, even though you're not totally sure they won't come in. And in the vegetation, you have to be careful that they're not going to be around there, because they already hide under any pot or anything like that.
[00:02:56.690] - Speaker 1
Of course. And can you identify and be poisonous snakes or non-venomous ones?
[00:03:02.680] - Speaker 2
The poisonous ones have a Roma tail and the non-venomous ones have a pointed tail.
[00:03:14.270] - Speaker 1
And do you know of any cases of snake bite?
[00:03:21.090] - Speaker 2
Yes, a neighbor.
[00:03:22.650] - Speaker 1
And what happened? Did he pass it in the field or at home?
[00:03:27.280] - Speaker 2
At home. I think he was in the pots and pans, that's all I knew.
[00:03:33.760] - Speaker 1
And did she or he go to the hospital?
[00:03:38.890] - Speaker 2
Yes, they took her to the hospital, to the Hospital del Carmen.
[00:03:43.350] - Speaker 1
And he received an anti-physicist?
[00:03:50.780] - Speaker 2
Yes, she received care there. I don't know what they gave her, but she was treated there.
[00:03:59.930] - Speaker 1
Okay, I have no more questions, but you have more to say about snakes or your knowledge of them.
[00:04:06.100] - Speaker 2
No, my knowledge of that is not very extensive.
[00:04:10.390] - Speaker 1
No, that's fine. And it's important to know that for a snakebite, it is not recommended to make a bandage, because the venom needs to circulate in the body and it is important not to panic. Yes. And it is important to go straight to the hospital.
[00:04:37.330] - Speaker 2
Yes, because you always get scared and run off to ask for help. But, well, just now I remembered, don't run, don't despair, because the more it is, waiting for the blood to work.
[00:04:51.610] - Speaker 1
Exactly, it's also important to stay calm. And if you need to go to the hospital in El Carmen, is it difficult for you or is it easy?
[00:05:06.270] - Speaker 2
Well, if I have transportation, it's easy.
[00:05:10.080] - Speaker 1
Do you have transportation?
[00:05:12.130] - Speaker 2
But as today, today there is no transportation, although those devices are stranded, so there is no transportation. Yes, okay.
[00:05:21.170] - Speaker 1
So, sometimes it's difficult.
[00:05:22.640] - Speaker 2
Yes, when you don't have transportation.
[00:05:26.810] - Speaker 1
And it's also important if you get bitten by a snake to know which snake you're biting, because there are different antiofísicos for corals or for vipers like carvings.
[00:05:42.180] - Speaker 2
And if it's a snake, because it bit a neighbor, I think a spider, and he said it was a snake and they gave him antivenom and it got worse.
[00:05:56.310] - Speaker 1
Yes.
[00:05:59.470] - Speaker 2
That's why it's good, at least the photo of the snakes, if you can't kill it. The photo. Or if you kill it, take it to the doctor to have a look at it. That's very important.
[00:06:12.470] - Speaker 1
It's very important, yes. But thank you, Liza. Good afternoon, doctor. You're very welcome.
