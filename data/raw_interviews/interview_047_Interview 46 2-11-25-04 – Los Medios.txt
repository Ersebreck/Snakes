[00:00:43.590] - Speaker 2
Okay. And you bit a snake, what happened? Can you explain more about your snake bite? This was one day
[00:00:58.560] - Speaker 1
No, it was a normal day, I was cleaning, we were in a spa, we were cleaning and I got mud on my feet, I got them dirty and I went to wash them at the foot of a pool where I had washed them before, but leaves had fallen and I stepped on the leaf and under the leaf was the snake. And the snake stepped on it. Did you step on it? Yes, I stepped on it. And then, as if by some defense mechanism of its own, it bit me, because I stepped on it. Otherwise, it wouldn't have bitten me. And from there they transferred me to the health center here, in Carmen de Apicala.
[00:01:52.710] - Speaker 2
And the farm was here?
[00:01:55.190] - Speaker 1
Yes, right away. They transferred me from the hospital, from the Carmen de Apicala health center, they transferred me to the hospital in El Espinal, Tolima.
[00:02:07.880] - Speaker 2
And then I'll say So what?
[00:02:14.950] - Speaker 1
I'm talking about a 24-hour coma.
[00:02:23.230] - Speaker 2
Hours?
[00:02:24.140] - Speaker 1
Yes, 24 hours. And after 24 hours, then I get But what the hell.
[00:02:34.050] - Speaker 2
And did he take a photo of the snake to the hospital or did he take the snake The snake.
[00:02:46.080] - Speaker 1
The snake immediately swallowed Chancleta. It swallowed her and then we took her to a cool place. And we took her to a cool place and then to the hospital. Because they told us it was a real coral, because there are fake ones.
[00:03:04.980] - Speaker 2
Yes, exactly.
[00:03:06.300] - Speaker 1
So, they told us it was real. So, from there, they referred me when they saw it, they referred me to the hospital.
[00:03:15.880] - Speaker 2
And did you receive the antiophysics immediately or after 24 hours?
[00:03:29.930] - Speaker 1
After 24 or about 36 hours, because here in Colombia there was no antrolic serum for coral snake bites. So, it was by chance that they found one and sent it for me to apply.
[00:03:53.320] - Speaker 2
And how long ago? Since the mower. What?
[00:04:03.250] - Speaker 1
No, 16 years ago.
[00:04:09.990] - Speaker 2
How awful, I'm sorry. And it's interesting because we do about 50 interviews and we talk to people with snake bites, but they're all snake bites of size X. I've never heard of a coral snake bite. It's different. And your symptoms.
[00:04:58.150] - Speaker 1
The symptoms are of Let's see what I feel like. Like hypothermia.
[00:05:04.460] - Speaker 2
Where it bit me, it bit my left foot and I felt it slipping away
[00:05:13.660] - Speaker 1
Like when you put your hand in ice, that feeling gradually crept up my skin. And after about 20 or 30 minutes, the lymph nodes, the ones in the neck and here the ones in the armpit, they became like oranges, like lemons.
[00:05:38.150] - Speaker 2
And after the bite, how did you know to go to the right hospital?
[00:05:49.070] - Speaker 1
Because something had already bitten him, so he already knew what the next step was. Then, And once he took me to the hospital.
[00:06:04.100] - Speaker 2
And did you feel pain immediately too or later? No. Later. After I felt the lymph nodes get bigger, I began to feel my tongue getting bigger.
[00:06:23.970] - Speaker 1
Then, as it got bigger, I couldn't get oxygen in.
[00:06:31.200] - Speaker 2
Yes, because the symptoms of corals are for the ism, it's for the ism of the body, I think. And you didn't make a tourniquet afterwards.
[00:06:57.240] - Speaker 1
That is, at the moment of the bite it bit me, it bit me I wash my foot, it squeezed hard, it tied me up. That is, the tourniquet, right? It tied my foot and there in the hospital they They already released it and they... And that's when the race began and I remember more or less after the snake bit me, let's say, for two hours. And then they told me that they were going to put me in a coma to protect my neurons.
[00:07:36.700] - Speaker 2
Yes.
[00:07:37.750] - Speaker 1
Because there was going to be a neuronal attack due to the toxicity of the venom and this was when I woke up at 11, 12 o'clock, you wake up completely sleepy, and much later they showed me what they were going to apply and that And now you have methods to prevent other snake bites. Right now we have, how do you say it? A cat. Yes, the truth is we have a cat. And yes, from there we always go up to where the cats were in the field. So, it's a control. And then it warns us. So, when the snake was very big, we heard the screams and we know, or the howls, that it's a snake.
[00:08:44.910] - Speaker 2
Of course.
[00:08:46.100] - Speaker 1
Well, okay.
[00:08:49.730] - Speaker 2
And now, where do you feel it is more likely that a snake will bite you? In the countryside or at home?
[00:09:00.130] - Speaker 1
Well, how? The house itself is in the countryside.
[00:09:06.430] - Speaker 2
Yes, exactly. It's the same thing.
[00:09:08.490] - Speaker 1
Yes. So, the house is very likely. For example, when There are times in summer when they start to arrive because they start to look for cool places. There it is.
[00:09:24.710] - Speaker 2
Hello, cat. It's called a butterfly. Butterfly or bonito. And I bit two snakes in this field, on this estate. No, not here, not here on this estate.
[00:09:44.620] - Speaker 1
On another estate that we had talked about, called El Tesoro. And he on another estate called Los Lagos, which is closer to the ravine and was more More wooded.
[00:10:02.570] - Speaker 2
And do you know of any other cases of snake bites?
[00:10:13.040] - Speaker 1
No, not like that. Him and you and no more.
[00:10:16.360] - Speaker 2
And no more, yes. Okay, good.
[00:10:20.150] - Speaker 1
And what do your children say about preventing snake bites? Here we have our customs, from there we learned to sleep with the light on, because of bugs, any bugs. And always with the doors closed, because you never know, they can come in from anywhere. And with the little girl we try to be like a cement block. We try not to go too far into the fields or the woods.
[00:11:09.550] - Speaker 2
And now, can you tell the difference between poisonous and non-poisonous snakes?
[00:11:19.000] - Speaker 1
Yes, but there is also a point there that it all depends on the person who is dead. That is, whether it is a non-venomous snake, a venomous snake, a stem, a coral. It's the person's level of allergy. Because according to the pathologist who sold it to me, who then did the check-up on me, he told me that it had gone really well because I had been bitten by a pretty little girl and she had injected me with all the venom she had, because she was small, so she didn't know how to dose the amount of venom. And the other one went very well for me because I'm not allergic to venom.
[00:12:10.550] - Speaker 2
Interesting, yes. And you killed the snake in And what was the moment? How does it feel? Flip-flop. Okay, flip-flop.
[00:12:22.280] - Speaker 1
And he had boots? He was in a bad way.
[00:12:30.830] - Speaker 2
In sores, okay. And, okay, I have no more questions, but you have more to say about your experience or your knowledge about snakes.
[00:12:44.280] - Speaker 1
No, always use protection, keep one in the field and above all footwear.
[00:12:52.580] - Speaker 2
Yes, exactly.
[00:12:53.840] - Speaker 1
Footwear with footwear, that is, leather boots. Yes, exactly. Because the rubber one also has its place, leather boots, which are a little tougher for him to sink his fangs into.
[00:13:10.280] - Speaker 2
And it's also important to know that snake bite remedies are bad because the poison needs to circulate in the body. And you know, but it's important to go straight to the hospital after a snake bite. Yes. But thank you very much. There. And I'm very sorry about the bite. But thank God, you're fine.
