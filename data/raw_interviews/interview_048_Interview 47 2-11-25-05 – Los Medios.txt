[00:00:27.650] - Speaker 2
What if you get bitten by a snake?
[00:00:32.920] - Speaker 1
I was bitten by a snake 24 years ago.
[00:00:36.640] - Speaker 2
And what happened?
[00:00:38.560] - Speaker 1
Well, one day I went out with some calves, steers, and it was already dark, it was already about 6:30 in the evening and I went out in flip-flops to close the gate. And I bent down to close the gate and the next thing I felt was that an animal had bitten my foot, but at the time I didn't pay any attention to what it was. Suddenly I must have been stung by something. At about 7:00, 7:30, my foot started to swell up.
[00:01:10.050] - Speaker 2
didn't he feel pain immediately?
[00:01:12.890] - Speaker 1
No, I was just a little bit on fire, but then I didn't think about it As I didn't see what it was, I said: But it's OK. At about 7:30, I said to her: Shine the light on me, as there was no light, when it was candles, so I said: Shine the light on me, something bit me. And on my foot I had two spots, one here and one here. So, we checked to make sure it wasn't a stab wound, but that it was a snake that had bitten me. And then, we took off at once and when there was no motorbike, it was a horse, we went to look for the horse for the paddock to show it and set off for the village. And already around here, halfway, then it happened - And did you kill the snake? No, because it was night, so the other day they came and looked. There was a bit of wood piled up, big sticks, at the bottom of the corral, where the cattle are.
[00:02:08.703] - Speaker 1
So, the grass snake was already there and it came out. And while I was stepping on it and once I stepped on it and once it bit me once and for all. And after two or three days, or on the second day, in the hospital they gave me the serum, they injected me with the serum.
[00:02:27.670] - Speaker 2
Afterwards, two days?
[00:02:28.780] - Speaker 1
Two days, because they didn't know, they said it was a spider, that suddenly it was one like the spider or the anteater also bites you. And as I didn't have proof that it was a snake, then at the end they did tests and my leg went purple, purple, purple. So, they did a test and yes, it was a snake. Then they gave me the serum. And when the moon is full, which is when I come to the moon here, my leg hurts from here to the bottom. Well, they say, I don't know, the people that the snake stayed alive. I don't know. That's the one that got bitten on the butt.
[00:03:15.110] - Speaker 2
And after the snakebite, you went straight to the hospital. Of course. In El Carmen, or where? In El Carmen. In El Carmen, yes, in El Carmen. And you stayed in the hospital in El Carmen?
[00:03:31.590] - Speaker 1
I lasted, what, 10, 12 days? Then they put my foot up, they hung it up, they tied my foot like that and my foot was up because my whole foot was all bruised and swollen. So they put ice, bags of ice on my foot to reduce the swelling.
[00:03:52.790] - Speaker 2
And how did they know which snake to kill?
[00:04:01.030] - Speaker 1
Well, according to what they said, in the colon, because that's what colon cancer measures. And around here, usually, there's a size called a size 2, which is not a very big size, it's small. That's what they said it was. So, according to the doctor who treated me, they saw that it was a size 2.
[00:04:24.470] - Speaker 2
And after the biting, what? Did you do any more like tourniquets?
[00:04:37.620] - Speaker 1
Yes, of course. Because one of the scare does nothing but make one tie oneself where something stung, tie oneself up. But then that's bad, because the blood doesn't circulate. There in the hospital, in the hospital they immediately drain you, they tell you: No, that doesn't have to be it. Because the blood doesn't circulate, the part where it stung can turn purple. And for example, the same thing happened to Marisol. I got scared and I tied her up with a rope, I can't remember what it was with, I just tied her up there and that was that. But you can't do that. That's why, because the doctor tells you, they tell you that. You can't do that.
[00:05:16.040] - Speaker 2
Yes. Okay, interesting. It's interesting, did you receive the anti-physicist After two days.
[00:05:32.160] - Speaker 1
Yes, of course.
[00:05:34.000] - Speaker 2
And now you know how to identify poisonous snakes or novenas.
[00:05:41.730] - Speaker 1
Of course.
[00:05:42.280] - Speaker 2
How can snakes identify each other?
[00:05:44.430] - Speaker 1
Because you see them and you don't: This one bit me or this one is a fellow who bit me. So, you have to be quiet or force yourself to see how you kill it, because if you don't, it forces you. And always have shoes on, because you usually get up late and if you're on foot, as it's on a flat, concrete surface, you walk. And as it's a warm climate here, when the snake is having a hard time, it looks for something damp and cool. Usually, they look in the pool where the bathrooms are, it always looks where you are, it curls up where it's cool. So, you get to the step and that's where the problem is. That's the thing about snakes. So, be careful with those.
[00:06:30.750] - Speaker 2
There are lots of sizes here.
[00:06:32.670] - Speaker 1
Yes, ma'am.
[00:06:33.510] - Speaker 2
And do you have other methods for preventing or avoiding snakebites?
[00:06:41.230] - Speaker 1
Always wear leather shoes, because if you wear rubber ones, that's because the snake's horn is like a needle. I killed one and we used a comb. And the horn, it's kind of curved. He came and grabbed it like this and left the poison there. So, no matter how well you're shod, the animal's mouth gets to you. From the moment you step on it, because from the moment you see it, it's already gone and nothing happens. But from the moment you suddenly touch it or trip over it, that's when you have to be careful because those bugs are dangerous.
[00:07:21.730] - Speaker 2
And do you know of any other cases of a snake grinding? No.
[00:07:29.150] - Speaker 1
There was another boy, but I don't remember where he went, that he got bitten by a snake. But look, on top of that. Because they already interviewed the one from the village. About a year ago that boy got bitten and that boy almost lost his leg. And it was also for the same reason in the summer, it happened that there was a pipe, I don't know what, and it went through a fence. And he arrived and asked, and there the snake was, right there. And there's another lady, the late one, they already interviewed her, Don Pedro's, and she was also stung. No, not yet. No, no, no, no, no. She was going to go inside from the school. No, we're not going to go. She was also stung by a culera snake about two or three years ago. And she also says: Now, what day was it? She gave me a glass of red wine and told me: Say, you also got a rash.
[00:08:18.698] - Speaker 1
And you say: Ma'am. And she's still kind of sick about it. Because they also took a long time to get her there and all that. Because that's what happens, that one First, you make home remedies. And when you see that it didn't get complicated, it's time to get going.
[00:08:35.460] - Speaker 1
Yes, that happens with those snakes.
[00:08:39.810] - Speaker 2
And now, where do you feel it is more likely that a snake will bite you? In the countryside or at home?
[00:08:48.910] - Speaker 1
In the field. In the field.
[00:08:50.920] - Speaker 2
Of course.
[00:08:52.110] - Speaker 1
Yes, because usually you have the work of materials, and you're close to the paddocks. Yes, exactly. You go to look at the drifts in the waterways and you're not careful. So, you're walking along when the log is there, it can grab you. That's what happens. Yes, in the countryside.
[00:09:14.960] - Speaker 2
Yes. And I have no more questions, but you have more to say about snakes or your knowledge or your experiences.
[00:09:26.070] - Speaker 1
No, that.
[00:09:27.410] - Speaker 2
Okay. Yes, and you know, but it's important to go straight to the hospital. To the hospital, of course. Then a snake movement.
[00:09:37.760] - Speaker 1
Yes, that's right, like that.
[00:09:38.960] - Speaker 2
And it is important to know which snake is stirring.
[00:09:42.310] - Speaker 1
Yes, the important thing is to know which snake it is, because each snake has its own serum.
[00:09:47.570] - Speaker 2
Yes, exactly. But you are experts in snake charmers, unfortunately.
[00:09:54.240] - Speaker 1
Yes, because back then when I was stung at the hospital, that's why they didn't treat me. That no, that it wasn't a snake, that no, it was a spider, that it was a lacrana, so they couldn't do anything for me. They did give me saline solution there, but saline solution to dehydrate. But the antiofisical saline solution, no, not until two days later, they explained that to me then.
[00:10:14.020] - Speaker 2
Yes, strange, interesting.
[00:10:16.560] - Speaker 1
Yes, ma'am.
[00:10:17.360] - Speaker 2
And, okay, that's it. Thank you very much and I'm sorry too, but thank you.
