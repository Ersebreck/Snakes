And it's a good thing there was a doctor there in the hospital, who was the hospital manager, Dr. Francisco. And he had a friend who was a pathologist, a snake charmer, at the Tolemaida base. So he consulted him right away, so he said to him: Look, take this, this and these tests, and send them to me, and I'll send them in the afternoon. And that was when he took it to the Ptolemaic base, when the results arrived, they said: It's an Xapa, it bit him there. And you have to, according to the weight of the patient and all that, you had to apply the right amount of antiophidic serum. But that was a long time ago, they did that.
[00:00:45.950] - Speaker 4
And yes, why didn't they say: Go to another hospital? Because that, if you know what I mean.
[00:00:57.170] - Speaker 1
Because they didn't believe it was a snake, then they said it was a lizard, that it was leneic to a lizard, that it was electric to a spider bite. So, they looked for everything except what I needed. So, to know that it was a Xapa, it was because the pathologist ordered tests and he later that he knew it was a Xapa and they measured the points.
[00:01:31.540] - Speaker 2
The dots. The diameter where the bug got out, yes.
[00:01:34.550] - Speaker 4
Of course.
[00:01:35.850] - Speaker 1
And according to the poison he had, that was it, because they took samples of the poison there.
[00:01:44.280] - Speaker 3
Some can't take it. And doesn't he sit down all that time? No. Because blood clots form in the blood. And a blood clot, and that reaches the heart. That's it, man.
[00:01:54.280] - Speaker 2
Yes, he told me that my whole leg went numb. It went numb for me.
[00:01:57.270] - Speaker 1
When he went to the hospital, he was the one who had to have his trousers cut off. And that story was even worse because we had just arrived.
[00:02:05.710] - Speaker 2
Well, the boy, we had been there about a year when things calmed down. And when there were no motorbikes or motorbikes and carts, those 25 years, they would bring meat to the village on horseback.
[00:02:19.690] - Speaker 5
Of course. We didn't even have a torch, our son went with a sperm and a milk territory, one of those clina milk territories, do you understand me?
[00:02:26.720] - Speaker 1
And put it in and go and find the horse.
[00:02:31.460] - Speaker 4
That's a story to make you laugh later.
[00:02:39.340] - Speaker 3
And to learn and follow the instructions. Of course. Because after what happened to you, I don't think you'll leave the house feeling confident again.
[00:02:48.300] - Speaker 2
No, for them it's over.
[00:02:49.580] - Speaker 1
There is something else that you did not mention, that you gloss over.
[00:02:52.950] - Speaker 2
Yes, I was telling Tulio, I fumigate. In other words, right now I'm fumigating, I have to be fumigating around the house for the animals, for the crickets, snakes. Exactly, yes. So, I always fumigate around the house to avoid all that, all that inconvenience.
[00:03:08.840] - Speaker 4
It's better. And now it's also easier to go to the hospital because there are motorbikes. Yes, that's the only thing.
[00:03:15.260] - Speaker 2
It's already provided for transportation, for everything.
[00:03:21.210] - Speaker 1
Now the only thing there is is the barrier. So, you arrive
[00:03:25.270] - Speaker 2
The GPS goes to the hospital and the transfer is delayed.
[00:03:27.470] - Speaker 1
If you don't have the SP, the one from the town, the one from So, that's it. They leave it at that and it's not that they're going to release you, which happened to us in December with the girl, we arrived and they didn't release us. They didn't say: At the moment, no. Here we can't give you a, here we can't give you an electrocardiogram, here we can't do this. That's why we're not going to leave you stranded. They let you go and they tell you what you have to do. No, they attend to you, they give you an exam, they give you acetaminophen and then they tell you: No, you have to wait for the referral.
[00:04:06.060] - Speaker 3
The referral can be made the next day.
[00:04:07.950] - Speaker 2
The next day, yes.
[00:04:08.570] - Speaker 1
And out of remission, what have I done for a clinic in Melgar, Gilardo, or Ivagué: No, there we have to wait, because it's like we're going to get a bed when the time is right. Maybe the ones in Lívano will send someone. Maybe the ones in Lívano.
[00:04:25.990] - Speaker 2
They send him far away.
[00:04:27.780] - Speaker 3
Then they start turning on you. You can die during the course.
[00:04:31.270] - Speaker 1
Yes, of course. There was more than one patient called - Last week, the Pica Pica boy, who was from the village.
[00:04:37.510] - Speaker 2
The day we were with the girl in the hospital, he was there and he said hello to me, because he came here with the doctor, when he came here, he brought him, a young boy. And he worked as if it were Medgar's day. And the day we were at the hospital, when he said hello to me, I said to him: Ma, and who is he? He said: It's Pica Pica, the guy with the mask, I said: Diabetes, I don't know what, but the boy was skinny, white as a sheet. And from there they took him to Solima, and there he died. Like last week the boy died. And he lasted that day, and lasted almost all day for me to do an exam. And he sat there, of course, the pain he had there would stop, he would sit down, he would sit down. And at about eight o'clock the boy died. Because the GPS takes a long time to make the agreement.
[00:05:28.492] - Speaker 2
So, there he arrives at the hospital and wait, wait. So, whoever doesn't have a good EPS is screwed, because that's the problem right now in hospitals.
[00:05:38.360] - Speaker 4
Yes, sad.
[00:05:42.620] - Speaker 1
And does this happen, as with housing, in the wrong place?
