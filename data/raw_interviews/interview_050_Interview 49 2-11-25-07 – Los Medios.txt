[00:02:22.330] - Speaker 2
Yes, quite a lot.
[00:02:24.270] - Speaker 1
Yes. And what usually happened? Did you know the bites happened in the field or in the house? In the house. In the house, okay. Yes. And do you know which snakes they were?
[00:02:40.590] - Speaker 2
In Guayacá.
[00:02:42.470] - Speaker 1
In Guayacá, okay. And were they carvings or were they other snakes? They weren't. You don't know? No. Okay. Well, I don't have any more questions, but the most important information is that after a snake bite, it's important to go to the hospital right away. And the hospital in Carmen doesn't have an antiofísico. The hospitals in Espinal, Girado, Melgar and Valle have antivenoms. And it's important not to make a tourniquet after a snakebite, because the blood needs to circulate. And it's also important to know which snake is moving, because there are different antivenoms for different snakes. And to prevent snakebites, it's important to look carefully and it's important You can fumigate your house and it's important to know that there are many snakes here. It's important to look carefully. Look carefully. And yes, that's the most important information. But that's it. Thank you very much. Do you have anything else to say about snakes or your knowledge of snakes or any questions?
[00:04:42.970] - Speaker 2
In Venezuela they say that the most poisonous is the coral tree. Yes, I have seen the coral tree. But the ones that tend to grow more there are the guayacanes. Now here in Colombia, no, I haven't seen one yet and I don't want to see one.
[00:05:03.310] - Speaker 1
Are you from Venezuela? Yes, I'm Venezuelan. And you moved here from Venezuela? If you know what I mean, sorry.
[00:05:20.930] - Speaker 2
Yes, now I've had to emigrate because of the situation in Venezuela. It's not very good there, what you earn is not enough to support yourself. And the education for children is not good there. And I have my little granddaughter studying and I decided to come to Colombia, because the education for children is better here.
