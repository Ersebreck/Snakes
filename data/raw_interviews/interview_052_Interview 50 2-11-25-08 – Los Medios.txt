Since I was born.

So, do you think it's likely that you'll be bitten by a snake here in El Carmen?

No, no, no. Trusting in God, no.
[00:00:40.630] - Speaker 2
Okay. But do you think it's likely that you'll be bitten by a snake here in El Carmen?
[00:00:48.100] - Speaker 1
No, no, no. No, I have taken precautions.

What do you mean?
[00:00:57.880] - Speaker 2
Any animals of yours, like your pets?

No, my dad.
[00:01:01.840] - Speaker 2
Your dad?
[00:01:03.040] - Speaker 1
Yes, it was bitten and on the other side an X-shaped carving.
[00:01:05.840] - Speaker 2
And what happened?
[00:01:07.310] - Speaker 1
No, it barely bit him, they told me and we left for Gerardo at once. Okay. Yes, because here, the hospital here is not You understand that here it is not... It doesn't have everything that is essential for a snake bite.
[00:01:24.950] - Speaker 2
And he went to Gerardo's.
[00:01:27.480] - Speaker 1
Yes, to Girardot, to the hospital in La Unica.
[00:01:29.220] - Speaker 2
And he received anti-physics.
[00:01:31.440] - Speaker 1
Yes, of course.
[00:01:32.120] - Speaker 2
And the snake bite happened in the field, or where?
[00:01:37.860] - Speaker 1
Yes, over there on the other side, in an area where we have the bushes.
[00:01:41.840] - Speaker 2
And did he go to the hospital immediately or did he wait a little while?
[00:01:51.330] - Speaker 1
No, we didn't go because they told me and we went with a bang, with a right. Immediately, okay. Because you can't stop from one day to the next, not even for anything, because it damages the organs. It destroys your organs.
[00:02:02.850] - Speaker 2
Yes. And now do you know how to prevent a snake bite?
[00:02:09.610] - Speaker 1
Well, yes, if you see it, make the kit. If you have no way of defending it, then it's better to just leave them there.
[00:02:18.940] - Speaker 2
And what would you do if you were bitten by a snake?
[00:02:23.480] - Speaker 1
No, because starting from one, not thinking of it that way, no.
[00:02:26.550] - Speaker 2
Okay.
[00:02:27.510] - Speaker 1
All at once, yes.
[00:02:33.250] - Speaker 2
And would you trust the hospital, the Carmen, to cure a snakebite?
[00:02:38.400] - Speaker 1
No, I don't trust it there, because there aren't enough requirements for anything.
[00:02:43.420] - Speaker 2
But would you trust other hospitals to cure you?
[00:02:46.250] - Speaker 1
Sure, in the garden, where all the best stuff is.
[00:02:50.140] - Speaker 2
And where do you feel it is more likely that a snake will bite you? In the countryside or at home?
[00:02:58.190] - Speaker 1
No, no.
[00:02:59.690] - Speaker 2
No. And can you identify poisonous snakes or non-venomous ones?
[00:03:07.200] - Speaker 1
Yes, of course.
[00:03:08.290] - Speaker 2
How to identify oneself?
[00:03:10.050] - Speaker 1
For example, size X, because it has an X on the top, and the coral is black with red, or the other one too, there's one that's red. And the polisher, which is brown. Those areas you can see here, they don't look like that anymore. Yes.
[00:03:31.020] - Speaker 2
And yes, ready? Do you know of any other cases of a snake charm?
[00:03:37.260] - Speaker 1
With other people? Others, yes. For example, upstairs in a ball, the ones from the attic. She, as it was about this time, the cook, as it was very dark, the lady went out like this to wash the bathroom. And she came a step and she stepped on her and once there, pay. As she was small, she thought: No, let's go to the hospital. No, no, tomorrow. By the time they took her, it was already too late, because she had already turned, nothing, everything. It swelled up and she was gone. That happens instantly, it can't last at all. Crises, yes. Yes, the lady passed away, that biter was gone.
[00:04:21.460] - Speaker 2
That's it. I have no more questions, but you have more to say about snakes or your knowledge of  No? No. No? No. No? No.
[00:04:32.080] - Speaker 1
Yes, I've seen them around, of course. Yes. I remember I was about six years old. So, 47 years ago we lived in our street below. Then, at that moment, a man passed by on a horse, and I was terrified, a door as high as that, but it was made of old wooden, right? So, the man said: Mr. Domingo, look, a cow just climbed through the door. And I was little, so Dad came and the lantern went into the room where we had it, into the room where I slept, because the animal was there, pinned up. And if you know what I mean, the animal was about two months long. I was little and it was like this, about two months long and Dad saw it pinned up there at the headboard. Well, it's a good thing he went over there with a club and killed it, because a polisher, imagine that, an animal bit that one, my goodness, he had to kill it, because what else could he do, what else could they do?
[00:05:29.277] - Speaker 1
Where else was that animal going to go? And it's up to you at the last minute, in self-defense, as the saying goes, because what else can you do.
[00:05:39.560] - Speaker 1
Yes, in self-defense, because I told him, if you don't do it to it, you're fucked. Really? One of those animals is dangerous.
[00:05:48.450] - Speaker 2
Sure, yes.
[00:05:49.910] - Speaker 1
And he had to do that, so that it wouldn't be used at that time. I remember, I was little, I was six years old. And this is where he bit him, there, on that side. Then he went over there in flip-flops and went to Cervantes for I don't know what. And I said: Don't go in chacalita because it's dangerous. Yes. All that stuff gets dirty. All that stuff gets dirty, those animals. And this humidity, to this day they start looking for warmth. Yes, it's dangerous. Yes, of course.
[00:06:19.370] - Speaker 2
And yes, you know, but it's important after a snake bite to go straight to the hospital.
[00:06:27.730] - Speaker 1
Sure, one. Yes, one. You don't have to press it once or twice and it's not fast. Exactly. And I didn't believe it. There's a story, for example, with the choir, that when she feels it, one goes there, it becomes like a belt It gets that wide. And she did it to me last time over there, on that side where the familiar. I opened the door where they told me how It had rained at around nine in the morning. I gave it hell. I'm going to be able to look at a couple, see if it's around there. When I come like this, with a bag like this, wide, I wonder what it is. And I've heard that it's this animal, and I went and said to him: With the back like this, like this. When I touched it a little, it comes with that twitch. I mean, so that you don't detect it, it jumps and bites you, one of those animals, my God.
[00:07:23.069] - Speaker 1
Yes, it's a wild animal. Hey, you can't play with one of those animals, can you? You can't play with it, it's not a toy animal. Not to play with, because sometimes there's no counter, sometimes there isn't one.
[00:07:38.230] - Speaker 1
It's his job to call the Tolemaira for the clinic staff and sometimes there's no Tolemaira. It gets difficult. And in summer, those animals get rampant and bite a lot of people. Yes, you hear about it all the time. In the hospitals: One of them bit someone for snake bites, from somewhere else, from somewhere else. It's a delicate matter.
[00:08:00.490] - Speaker 2
And do you have transportation to go to the hospital if necessary?
[00:08:06.820] - Speaker 1
Yes, of course. I have the vehicle here. Okay, good. Yes. And for anyone else too. You never know.
[00:08:19.370] - Speaker 2
That's it. Thank you very much.
[00:08:22.000] - Speaker 1
Not in the right time, because the truth is not No, no. Yes? Not even for a while, because we don't drink here. Oh. Let's go there. We'll have a drink in the shop.
