And what do you do for work, if you work?
[00:00:25.910] - Speaker 2
I work in the mountains planting yuccas, in Hablecultura. Well. Rounding up snakes. Except that one, because I don't owe him.
[00:00:36.300] - Speaker 1
And are you married or single?
[00:00:39.390] - Speaker 2
I live with her in a non-marital partnership.
[00:00:43.390] - Speaker 1
And how many years have you lived in El Carmen?
[00:00:47.420] - Speaker 2
76.
[00:00:49.540] - Speaker 1
And do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:54.230] - Speaker 2
Of course, there are snakes everywhere. You just have to be very careful. Yes. Very careful. Be careful.
[00:01:01.440] - Speaker 1
Yes. And have any of your animals been bitten by a snake? No, ma'am.
[00:01:08.180] - Speaker 2
Goodness gracious. The only one who bit me still has me alive.
[00:01:14.490] - Speaker 4
Were there four?
[00:01:16.970] - Speaker 2
There were four snakes, weren't there?
[00:01:18.530] - Speaker 1
Yes, down there. Yes, there is too much of it.
[00:01:24.350] - Speaker 4
And what color were they? Black.
[00:01:28.850] - Speaker 3
Black? When they're under the mud, when they come out from under the mud? Where do they breed?
[00:01:32.520] - Speaker 4
I think they were rotten. I think they're doing I think they were rotten. It's just that that area is very close.
[00:01:39.590] - Speaker 1
In your backyard?
[00:01:40.690] - Speaker 2
There in his backyard, over there. In the neighboring country. Yes.
[00:01:46.580] - Speaker 1
And do you know how to prevent or avoid a snakebite?
[00:01:52.380] - Speaker 2
Be very careful.
[00:01:53.830] - Speaker 1
Yes.
[00:01:54.670] - Speaker 2
Be very careful. Because the snake bit you, which is a big deal. Just like Peter said, yuca. And what would you do if you were bitten by a snake? Wait for one to bite you, because there's no cure, there's no paste at all, there's no antidote, there's nothing that will kill it.
[00:02:18.930] - Speaker 4
Where? I'll keep my mouth shut, I'm not saying anything, there's no point
[00:02:21.680] - Speaker 2
There are no wasted words, but it's the reality, man, what are we looking at with the government we have, that there is nothing, there is nothing but  In the hospital, in Carmen? You don't get the antidote for the snake bite, you don't get it. How many haven't died? Why is that? They get bitten in Cundá and everywhere else. It's not the first or the last.
[00:02:45.120] - Speaker 4
But just to be sure, his wife was saved from a snake.
[00:02:49.370] - Speaker 2
But because he gave him the orugo gel, right?
[00:02:52.380] - Speaker 1
But he took the discharge key. Wouldn't you trust the antidotes?
[00:02:59.060] - Speaker 2
Sure, but there aren't any.
[00:03:01.510] - Speaker 1
In El Carmen or in all hospitals?
[00:03:04.560] - Speaker 2
Practically none.
[00:03:06.900] - Speaker 1
In what? I'm sorry.
[00:03:07.780] - Speaker 2
None.
[00:03:09.440] - Speaker 3
The National Allergy Institute where I was doing the antibiotic for nursing.
[00:03:13.660] - Speaker 2
Of course, that's over.
[00:03:15.040] - Speaker 4
And where did Don Tulio have his wife? What sentence?
[00:03:17.340] - Speaker 3
In the spine.
[00:03:19.480] - Speaker 4
But they put the old one on the spine, otherwise it wouldn't have been saved.
[00:03:23.570] - Speaker 3
But because he was lucky. And he doesn't have the resources to reach the ground. You don't have to be careful.
[00:03:31.230] - Speaker 1
You wouldn't trust other hospitals to cure a snakebite.
[00:03:37.050] - Speaker 2
Most of them ask the army brigade for help, because they'll send them to another country to get injections, but you have to ask them for cocoa. Here in the hospital, there's the sign with the big lizards, the cascabelle, all those snakes. But the sign, go and see if there are any old people, then there aren't any. So, you don't need a sign, you need the medicine.
[00:04:10.220] - Speaker 1
Okay, yes. And where do you feel it is more likely that you will be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:04:21.380] - Speaker 2
Well, you know, it's starting to feel like the animals from the forest are coming into the houses. Of course. They are coming. I called you before from here. They can be in the forest, well yes, there are queens of that kind. And big. And around here they send the young to And the snake, since it's bigger, and do they give the big one a lethal injection for biting the little one? They say, well, I don't know.
[00:04:51.460] - Speaker 1
The same, I think.
[00:04:53.040] - Speaker 2
Can they be the same thing?
[00:04:53.540] - Speaker 1
Of course, a large snake injects, as I have heard on television, an average of four or five centimeters of venom in the bite.
[00:05:06.820] - Speaker 2
They inject her with the bite. And they don't inject the little one with as much, but it's poison and also deadly.
[00:05:12.390] - Speaker 1
Exactly, yes, it's the truth. No, I'm just thinking about it.
[00:05:16.630] - Speaker 2
Because several people have been killed by the tala and all the people who have been bitten by them are just like that, aren't they? About that big. Doña María, the one from Novillo, wasn't killed by a tala. Why did they kill her? Because there was no antidote, they didn't give it to her, they didn't get it, it wasn't available.
[00:05:33.840] - Speaker 4
And that she didn't come down fast.
[00:05:35.260] - Speaker 2
And that's why.
[00:05:36.080] - Speaker 3
But that's why I'm telling you.
[00:05:37.650] - Speaker 4
She came down the next day, she stayed like that and came down until the next day. And when she came down the next day from the corpse, why?
[00:05:43.940] - Speaker 2
No, the snake, they say, that snake kills you in two or three days. The coral kills you in a day, it kills you. From the moment it starts, the ator kills you. The rattlesnake kills you in ten minutes. It took your skin and in ten minutes it's on you and you don't have your old skin to put on. That's what I've heard about that thing, the rattlesnake, the one that stops your tail and makes the rattle.
[00:06:12.870] - Speaker 1
Yes, yes, yes.
[00:06:15.710] - Speaker 2
The cógra, the cógra, if there isn't any, that.
[00:06:18.850] - Speaker 4
There's a lot of la What's it called?
[00:06:21.740] - Speaker 2
The rotting one. The rotting one and the other one. For those, if they haven't made you antithetical, for the rotting one. And the
[00:06:28.600] - Speaker 4
What's it called?
[00:06:30.230] - Speaker 1
The one that stings Honestly, I don't know the puridora. I don't know which snake is the puridora. But yes, I listened. Do you know how to identify whether snakes are poisonous or non-poisonous? And why is the snake poisonous or non-poisonous?
[00:06:45.890] - Speaker 2
Why is the snake poisonous? It's the carving, the coral, because there's a lot of it around here. There are rattlesnakes too. The purging pit viper is poisonous, but they don't kill like that, they kill it over time, according to the doctors. They haven't given it the antidote, because it's all just rotting away.
[00:07:09.820] - Speaker 3
Alright, don't come, you're not going to see the cockerel. Come on.
[00:07:16.930] - Speaker 2
In the plains, for example, in the Caquetá jungle and plains, there are many kinds of snakes that one neither hears mentioned nor knows. Because, for example, they say that in the plains there is this one called the berrugoso, that the four noses say is the same size.
[00:07:35.890] - Speaker 1
Yes, it is the same one.
[00:07:37.130] - Speaker 2
That's what they say. The wrinkly one? The wrinkly one, that's another one I think it's like the rotten one around here.
[00:07:44.060] - Speaker 1
And how do you identify snakes? By looking at them.
[00:07:51.440] - Speaker 2
Looking at them. This is size, this is
[00:07:54.890] - Speaker 1
And what characteristics do you know? What? What characteristics?
[00:08:02.600] - Speaker 3
Characteristics.
[00:08:03.820] - Speaker 1
Characteristics. Characteristics. Do you know which are poisonous or which are not poisonous?
[00:08:09.980] - Speaker 2
The poisonous snake has fangs. The one that is not poisonous has no fangs. For example, the donkey has no fangs. Yes. Before being a lover of the stalk, because now she thinks she is showing her fangs.
[00:08:28.160] - Speaker 4
And what is the one that you say is not Culebra, the snake. And isn't that one poisonous that said that day: No, that one is not dangerous?
[00:08:32.140] - Speaker 2
There are many snakes that are not poisonous, for example, the savannah snake, the butcher, which is a totally red snake. The savannah snake is a snake that is between gray and yellow and almost black, but it is not poisonous either because it has no fangs. The fact that the snake has no canine teeth does not mean it is not poisonous because it does not bite. What it does is that it has a saw to catch it swallowing. For example, the cazadora, the cazadora is a snake that grows bigger and bigger, but it is not poisonous. That is quite different from the others. The boba, the boba is the same but half. That one is not poisonous either. It has a slime that
[00:09:20.040] - Speaker 1
It's like they took a sock that was laced with marijuana, but that's not something that would kill you. And do you know of a case of a snake bite?
[00:09:35.050] - Speaker 2
I've heard several that have been bitten by snakes. Carving, the most, a little more that the carving and the rotting, and the coral are handled. And the coral. But the most that I've heard that a woman bit, a slut, around here.
[00:09:58.540] - Speaker 1
Well, I have no more questions, but do you have anything more to say about snakes or your knowledge of them?
[00:10:08.100] - Speaker 2
Well no, I've never pulled that stunt, but I see them and I'll kill them. Of course, because she's not going to let herself be taken. As long as I can get to her, I'll kill her. Not the rest.
[00:10:23.590] - Speaker 1
And the most important information The hospitals in Espinal, Melgar and Bagay, all outsiders, Carmen has the anti-physicist.
[00:10:39.250] - Speaker 2
It has anti-curls.
[00:10:40.380] - Speaker 1
Yes. And it's important to go straight to hospital after a snakebite.
[00:10:48.640] - Speaker 2
After he died.
[00:10:50.620] - Speaker 1
Yes. No, in hospitals. Yes. No, no, no, no, no, in the sector? Yes, of course. If I need to go to the Carmen and get a referral, then going to the Espinal or Giradur or others is the solution for a bite. I mean, here in the Carmen there aren't any.
[00:11:35.720] - Speaker 3
Yes. But I say yes. Yes, yes. Here in El Carmen there isn't, but in Giradur, in El Espinal, at work? Yes.
[00:11:46.050] - Speaker 4
Because this Hospital del Carmen is immense, it is very big.
[00:11:49.290] - Speaker 2
The structure is. So, I think that The structure is great, but it doesn't achieve that remedy, it doesn't.
[00:11:57.460] - Speaker 3
And it should be because it was so hot to have the antidote, but there isn't any. There isn't any. There isn't any hint of
[00:12:04.840] - Speaker 4
Another girl was also stung by one, but I think that one was the coral, the one they said, the one that stung this Maricela, the one who lives in Caribupay.
[00:12:16.230] - Speaker 2
That was Coral, right? How do you say the other one? Or is it talla? Talla or Coral?
[00:12:21.270] - Speaker 1
Chorus.
[00:12:22.190] - Speaker 4
choir?
[00:12:23.140] - Speaker 1
Choral, yes.
[00:12:25.050] - Speaker 4
Is that how you want it, little one? Yes. She said it's to die for. And they also took her to
[00:12:32.680] - Speaker 1
I know. We interviewed her yesterday. You did?
[00:12:42.230] - Speaker 4
Do you see that she was a coral? Yes, she was a coral. In the van he wasn't stung.
[00:12:46.590] - Speaker 2
It stung him with its paw.
[00:12:47.990] - Speaker 4
In other words, she was in the bathroom and it itched.
[00:12:52.040] - Speaker 1
Yes. It's important to go straight to the hospital. And in Carmen there is no anti-physicist. Often, often. But in the spinal, turn it, and bagué.
[00:13:06.160] - Speaker 3
Neither one has transportation or the money for a doctor.
[00:13:09.890] - Speaker 1
Yes, I want to ask, is it difficult for you to go to hospitals or is it not difficult for you to go to hospitals?
[00:13:21.200] - Speaker 2
Well, as long as she's okay, the hospital will provide transportation, the ambulance.
[00:13:28.270] - Speaker 1
And is the ambulance expensive?
[00:13:30.680] - Speaker 2
But if it's in a bad way, the ambulance doesn't have a driver, it's drinking. The ambulance has no petrol, no, it stalled. But yeah, there's an ambulance there. And they take the patients, when it's in good shape, when it's in bad shape. Yes.
[00:13:46.160] - Speaker 4
In other words, Camilo was taken by the ambulance when.
[00:13:48.990] - Speaker 2
That's why, when it's in good condition. The best old-fashioned one for snake-shaped soap is the olive oil soap.
[00:14:00.090] - Speaker 1
It is not a solution, it does not work.
[00:14:04.090] - Speaker 2
Doesn't it work? No. No? No. Why doesn't it work?
[00:14:08.140] - Speaker 1
Because it doesn't work, it doesn't work, I'm sorry. But the only solution is to go straight to the hospital. Antiphysics is the only one.
[00:14:21.700] - Speaker 2
Anti-physicist, yes.
[00:14:22.820] - Speaker 1
For biting poisonous snakes.
[00:14:24.950] - Speaker 2
Be careful, you come to the hospital with the snake bite, because I've heard that version, you come to the hospital with the snake bite and they say to you: Where is the snake? Which snake bit you? Oh, bring it.
[00:14:37.900] - Speaker 1
Yes, it is also important.
[00:14:39.170] - Speaker 3
But how are you going to tell a snake it will bite you, it's going to put you off until it catches you. Yes. Maybe a levitating one will bite you.
[00:14:45.780] - Speaker 2
Yes, let's see, María, let's see who's the baddest. Hey, so why does yesterday's news about animals and people work? It's not good.
[00:14:59.940] - Speaker 1
It is not recommended, no.
[00:15:01.950] - Speaker 2
Why?
[00:15:03.770] - Speaker 1
Why? Yes, why. I can't explain, but it's important. The anti-physicist is the only one.
[00:15:16.250] - Speaker 2
Yes.
[00:15:17.650] - Speaker 1
Yes.
[00:15:18.340] - Speaker 2
Come on, I'll tell you this. Where I work, you know the dogs, you know them, you know the owner. Those dogs, the tallas, because there's one up there above the tallas, where even the tallas can't remember, lurking, waiting for them. Three dogs have been bitten by the tallas. And that's within half an hour, within an hour they've got an arm or a leg, but this thick. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, No, it's not working.
[00:16:01.270] - Speaker 1
Okay, yes, yes you have it, well, but you also need to go to the hospital.
[00:16:09.330] - Speaker 2
Yes, it could be, but for a first emergency, if there's any borago gel, use the borago one. Yes, of course.
[00:16:18.240] - Speaker 3
The photo of the runner.
[00:16:22.010] - Speaker 1
Which one? In the case of a Explain it. I have?
[00:16:29.310] - Speaker 3
Explain. In case they die, it's good to have their photo.
[00:16:32.610] - Speaker 1
Yes, that too. Yes, of course. Yes, it's important to know which snake is biting itself.
[00:16:38.460] - Speaker 2
But tell me something, Tulio. And you can also forgive me for saying this. I, for example, don't know how to use those machines, I don't know how to use a cell phone at all, I can't answer or dial.
[00:16:54.010] - Speaker 1
But it's also killing her and bringing the snake to the hospital.
[00:17:00.210] - Speaker 2
Well, and that's what they're doing, they ordered him to look for the snake, to kill it or take it alive, because now it's a crime to kill the snake. Look, Holy One. Because he's asking him again for the venom to come out. Yes.
[00:17:13.870] - Speaker 1
Yes. Okay, well, that's all I've got, but thank you very much. And yes, thank you very much.
[00:17:23.110] - Speaker 2
Do you like red wine?
