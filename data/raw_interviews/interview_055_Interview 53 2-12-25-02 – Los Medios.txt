[00:00:01.330] - Speaker 1
And what is your name?
[00:00:02.960] - Speaker 2
Santiago Rodríguez.
[00:00:04.370] - Speaker 1
And do you agree with the recording and the interview?
[00:00:08.380] - Speaker 2
No, I can't see, I'm asking myself a normal question, yes, of course. Thank you.
[00:00:13.000] - Speaker 1
And how old are you?
[00:00:14.980] - Speaker 2
69.
[00:00:16.590] - Speaker 1
And what do you do for a living?
[00:00:18.470] - Speaker 2
I have been pensioned off by the Ministry of Health.
[00:00:22.660] - Speaker 1
And are you married or single?
[00:00:24.650] - Speaker 2
Married.
[00:00:25.930] - Speaker 1
And how many years have you lived in El Carmen?
[00:00:29.560] - Speaker 2
No, that's right, I've been doing it for three years now.
[00:00:33.340] - Speaker 1
So, do you think it's likely that you'll be bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:38.240] - Speaker 2
Of course, we are dealing with a snake if it doesn't have the antidote or the problem that it can only be sent by me in the fast, in 24 hours. So, the risk is that here in Carmen, if it is a town, because this is already a big town, and they don't have the antidote for the snake, I think it's terrible, because supposedly the state, and this is a mountainous area and a high-risk area, because of the altitude, because of the snake, there are a lot of snakes here. And then, one is At the will of my God, one is there in whatever one has to face, because here they have caught snakes in the bathroom, under the bed. So, one doesn't know what one is dealing with when one sleeps with the snake. You sleep with the big snake and you get the smaller one, worse.
[00:01:29.320] - Speaker 1
Yes.
[00:01:30.270] - Speaker 2
That day he wakes up dead. It's difficult, mainly because of the people, because if we had the solution here in the hospital, there wouldn't be a problem, because obviously the snakes are from here, from the hot lands, and that's where they live, and right now it's forbidden to kill them.
[00:01:50.300] - Speaker 1
And have any of your animals been bitten by a snake?
[00:01:57.830] - Speaker 2
No, I haven't shared that. I've worked collecting them in the bush, how they are caught with their snake, with their noose, with all that. Poisoning them. I know how to do everything about the snake. And the mice are inoculated to extract the anti-physic serum, to prepare the actito.
[00:02:19.840] - Speaker 1
And do you know how to prevent or avoid snake-like deceit?
[00:02:26.770] - Speaker 2
Avoid the viper's bite, so be careful, have Have luck. Have a heat wave. Have luck, because you are going at night For example, tomorrow I was cleaning out a bit of dirt, the one with the pipe was running, the septic tank was full and there were four snakes joined together. So, there was already one like that, a big one like that. So, just to be on the safe side, you shouldn't kill them because they're not doing anything to you, but you live there. So, I had to kill them because it's like that. The mother must have been over there.
[00:02:58.730] - Speaker 3
Dangerous. And that's not discounted?
[00:03:01.870] - Speaker 2
No, because it's about looking after your health. Here you don't have serum, you don't have the solution at hand. Not even in Bogotá was that the case, because we had, for example, we have to realize that when we made an antiophidic serum, we had the snake house in an armory. When the armory collapsed, it wiped out all the culeras. We had 300 asses, which is where the venom was extracted to prepare the antiophidic serum. This is prepared from the blood of mules and horses.
[00:03:36.040] - Speaker 1
Exactly.
[00:03:37.370] - Speaker 2
That's a very beautiful job, it's a very beautiful art. Working with animals is highly risky, but it's a spectacular, beautiful job. Or seeing one of those snakes.
[00:03:48.490] - Speaker 1
And are you a health professional? What? You work? You're a health professional?
[00:03:59.560] - Speaker 2
No, I was an administrative assistant, I received laboratory samples, I attended to the public and I worked in the laboratory. And we also prepared the rabies vaccine, for dogs and for humans, which was three The little mice were inoculated in the head from one to three days after birth, I inoculated them with the virus to prepare the human antirabies serum and from three to five days for the dogs. Back then, it was a beautiful art. Suddenly, from the smell of the meowing, the mice, but it was a spectacular job, you liked it. You have to like these things. So, I have experience and I haven't seen one of those animals, it didn't upset me much. Yes, interesting. Because I already have the experience.
[00:04:49.420] - Speaker 1
Yes. So, do you know how to prevent a snakebite or what the risk is?
[00:04:59.220] - Speaker 2
No, it's not that he should be brought here, that he should run, get anxious and look for help quickly. So, if they can't take him here in the ambulance, you see what you can do, but don't let him die, go to Girardó, go to Espinal. But then the problem with that is where the resources are here.
[00:05:21.390] - Speaker 1
Yes, it's a bit expensive to go to Espinal.
[00:05:26.140] - Speaker 2
Transport is expensive. So, if you don't know your way around, or you run the risk of going on a motorbike or something and you dropped the bag and fell and killed yourself, even worse. So, the difficult thing is that in this town, which is already a big town, we don't have a more complex hospital for the risks we take here, because there are a lot of snakes here, a lot. Humans and animals. And what would you do if you were bitten by a snake? Well, what can I say? If you can't catch it, it's distressing, because often you don't realize it. It bit you, but you jumped and didn't realize if it was a snake or not, what happened. But then the pain will keep bothering you, you don't know what it was, if once If you don't know what kind of animal it was, even worse. Then how are you going to explain that you didn't bring it, that you didn't kill it, that you didn't take any more photos of it.
[00:06:20.748] - Speaker 2
The snake: Wait for me, I'm going to take a photo of it so I can go to the doctor. No, you can't do that. Well, Lucho. Yanko.
[00:06:29.140] - Speaker 1
Be careful.
[00:06:30.120] - Speaker 2
It's difficult, it would have to be here in a part of here, that one sees it and can take a photo of it, but the first thing one doesn't do is kill it.
[00:06:38.350] - Speaker 3
But you have to go and kill them, because there are some that you can't see.
[00:06:41.800] - Speaker 1
And take them to the hospital, yes.
[00:06:44.200] - Speaker 2
And take them to the hospital, if possible. I lived with them and worked with them, but I respect them, they are animals, they are gods, they are gods. And they don't do anything to you, and you don't bother them.
[00:07:01.100] - Speaker 1
Also. So, would you trust the Carmen hospital to cure you?
[00:07:07.930] - Speaker 2
Not right now, because there are no drugs. If there aren't any, there aren't any for us, let alone for the anti-anxiety drugs to grow. In the hospital, suddenly, it's not their fault, it's the management of the government that we have that is so corrupt. This one is more corrupt than all the rest. They have all been thieves and robbers, but these are the champions. This really was the end of everything. This really was it, they took the budget away from everything. They're fucking mad. And you have to learn to speak Spanish, otherwise they'll kidnap you too. You and a gringa, we've got a chat here. Watch out with that, there's no papaya.
[00:07:43.560] - Speaker 3
Sure, he gets a good haul. Sure, the man rides high.
[00:07:46.380] - Speaker 2
Of course, man is well mounted, now.
[00:07:48.940] - Speaker 3
A guard carries a respect back pack, look.
[00:07:52.160] - Speaker 2
The doctor. No, actually I did. Of course it was before, now, well, it's healed now. Janco, please. Not anymore, bro.
[00:08:01.050] - Speaker 1
And where do you feel it is more likely that a snake will bite you? In the countryside or at home?
[00:08:07.650] - Speaker 2
In the field. In the field. Yes, because you go out, I didn't see anyone going out this morning to weed there to remove some of the mud and there were snakes there. So, well I've seen here, here it happens in the street, there a motorbike or a car goes by and it guts them, it kills them. Snakes lie there dead at dawn, so you think: oops! From a threat to a danger you didn't go into the house, it's another thing, because you don't know what it's like. But as long as you don't attack them or disturb them there, nothing's going to happen. But suddenly you go in to have a bath and you're up to there, you step on it, then you're in trouble. But you don't see why it wanted to attack you or anything, just that it's going to defend itself from you.
[00:08:48.000] - Speaker 3
No, and because that was the order given to him by the boss: If they step on you, bite them.
[00:08:52.000] - Speaker 2
And of course, if he feels harassed, he goes there.
[00:08:56.060] - Speaker 3
That gave the snake a lesson: If they step on you, bite back.
[00:08:59.630] - Speaker 2
Yes. So what's best for you?
[00:09:03.340] - Speaker 1
And can you identify poisonous snakes or non-venomous ones?
[00:09:08.760] - Speaker 2
We work with the coral snake, the python. The python is a very dangerous snake. And it's very big, it's a snake that grows up to two meters long. And it's a snake Snake is an impression. So, one sees a snake... Yeah. And one sees here little worms this big, the biggest I've seen is like this. But the ones that one saw that were two meters long, 80, I don't know what, and they tell me: Those are real snakes. You have to be afraid of those, because that's how they are. And I worked in the mountains. Of course, in the mountains I went with boots and all the protection. But nevertheless, that is risky and there were some terrible snakes. There it was with a photo. And that over there? A very nice job, it was a very cool job. I spent about 20 years in that job. I had to retire because the time comes when you become psychologically affected. Then you start to get sick.
[00:10:18.180] - Speaker 2
But it was a nice job. There were colleagues who were bitten by the same snakes, their fingers would dry up. And we produced the antidote right there.
[00:10:30.160] - Speaker 2
But nevertheless, some who lost their fingers so those who handled them. So, when they went to handle them, they didn't touch the brandy or the whiskey. In those days, they used it so much. But it was a good job, let's say, they are animals to be respected. But it was a very nice job. And you have to know how to handle them, right? Yes. I have nothing against snakes, because they are normal animals, as long as you don't bother or attack them, they won't hurt you, they're an insect. And even though you say that you couldn't see them too, if there weren't any snakes, there wouldn't be any antidote for the poison, so to speak, to prepare the poison. And unfortunately, the same poison is used. So, that poison is applied to the mules, to the horses, and then three, four liters of blood are taken from the horses and that blood is used to prepare it. Exactly. We had a farm in Madrid to prepare that serum.
[00:11:33.134] - Speaker 2
10 mules, those poor animals end up with terrible lacerations. And when they clean it, they're left with a metal grate. Will he do something to your mom, Tito? Thanks, man. That one was terrible. The only thing I didn't like was how those mules suffered when they injected them.
[00:11:53.600] - Speaker 2
So, back then when they saw us I fought for where the galiana was but whistled, I was already afraid of it because they already knew what was going to happen to them. Then it was time, a day or two later, to catch them so we could inoculate them. Because imagine, the animal was inoculated with pure venom. On the third day, I took its blood to prepare the.
[00:12:20.510] - Speaker 1
And do you know of any cases of snake moray eels?
[00:12:25.190] - Speaker 2
Well, my colleagues, but at work. I can tell you about one who lost two fingers. There are the misos. Yes, we had poisonous toads there that were brought from Africa. We had poisonous caterpillars, poisonous rattlesnakes and poisonous snails, some impressive snails. I'm not telling you that these here are roundworms, what you saw over there. Over there, the institute bought them, so all those people from Armero, Girardón and all that. They would go with some sacks and four or five snakes and they would buy them.
[00:13:08.210] - Speaker 1
That's it, I have no more questions, but you have more to say about snakes or your knowledge of snakes. And what do you think?
[00:13:15.570] - Speaker 2
I have a lot of knowledge, that's why they don't scare me. Here the risk is what I'm telling you, because we don't have the anti-hubic being, but as long as I see it and as long as I don't roast it or step on it, as I told you, by accident, it's possible that one of them will bite you, well you can let it live, but if it's going to come into the house, well no, that's different. I take care of myself first, myself second, myself third. Afterwards, I have to get rid of it because there's no other way. But the rest, I think I'm not saying that animals like insects and amphibians are spectacular, but it's scary to see them.
[00:14:00.090] - Speaker 3
And because to walk in their footsteps you have to respect them.
[00:14:04.270] - Speaker 2
And when we at the snake house throw 500, 600 mice at those animals, they already come down to see the snakes, as I no longer saw. Well, let's eat.
[00:14:14.340] - Speaker 1
Well, thank you very much. That's all I have to say, but thank you very much.
