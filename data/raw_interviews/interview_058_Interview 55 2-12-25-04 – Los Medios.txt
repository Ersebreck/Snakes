Twenty-five.
[00:00:05.130] - Speaker 1
And what do you do for a living?
[00:00:06.770] - Speaker 2
Construction site resident.
[00:00:08.760] - Speaker 1
And are you married or single? Single, yes, ma'am. And how many years have you lived in El Carmen?
[00:00:16.730] - Speaker 2
I was born here, but I currently live in Bogotá, I've been living in Bogotá for more than 15 years. But my mom lives here in El Carmen.
[00:00:23.370] - Speaker 1
And do you think it's likely that you'll be bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:28.270] - Speaker 2
A lot, yes. Why? Because in the area we have a lot of forest around us, a lot. And we have found that they can reach the house here.
[00:00:38.210] - Speaker 1
And has any animal of yours been killed by a snake?
[00:00:42.390] - Speaker 2
In this one, not many years ago, but I had a cat that was, it was bitten by a snake. And did it die? Yes, it died. I'm sorry. Yes, thank you.
[00:00:50.900] - Speaker 1
And do you know how to prevent or avoid a tan from that animal?
[00:00:54.460] - Speaker 2
No, let's say that what we've done is that when they get bitten, we give them milk to drink and maybe that helps them, but nothing more.
[00:01:01.900] - Speaker 1
And before a snake bite, do you know how to avoid one?
[00:01:07.500] - Speaker 2
No, miss.
[00:01:09.100] - Speaker 1
And what would you do if you were bitten by a snake?
[00:01:12.200] - Speaker 2
Well, from what I've seen on TV, it would mainly be like in the movie "La zona", depending on where it attacks you, to prevent that blood from continuing to circulate. So it would be to make a tourniquet or something like that, like sealing it with some clothing or something, more like that.
[00:01:28.850] - Speaker 1
And would you trust the hospital, in El Carmen, to cure a snakebite?
[00:01:35.280] - Speaker 2
Yes, now, because the protocols have improved a lot, I would say yes.
[00:01:39.450] - Speaker 1
And would you also trust other hospitals to cure a snake near El Carmen?
[00:01:45.830] - Speaker 2
Yes, what they do is move them to bigger ones, but yes, yes, yes, yes, sir.
[00:01:50.710] - Speaker 1
And where do you feel it is more likely that a snake will bite you? In the countryside or at home?
[00:01:57.690] - Speaker 2
They've arrived here at the house, you know? So, it's also probable, yes.
[00:02:03.630] - Speaker 1
And can you tell the difference between poisonous snakes and non-venomous ones? No, definitely not that. And do you know of any type of snake?
[00:02:13.880] - Speaker 2
Not around here, not around here. Do you know who? The animals, the cows, mainly. You hear that some neighbors have had an animal die because of it, but I haven't seen it like that when I was older.
[00:02:23.890] - Speaker 1
And that's it. I have no more questions, but you have more to say about snakes with your knowledge.
[00:02:30.930] - Speaker 2
No, it's more that the knowledge that people have here, people from the countryside, is very limited, mainly because they keep themselves very isolated here. So, let's say that their knowledge, their education is very basic. Yes, it's very little, but yes, that would be all. No problem. Yes, yes, yes.
[00:02:46.020] - Speaker 1
And well, then, the important information, if you get a snake bite, it's important to go straight to the hospital for antidotes, antiophthalmic. And in El Carmen they don't have any. There aren't any. In the hospital in El Carmen, yes. So, you need to go to El Carmen, possibly for a referral.
[00:03:15.840] - Speaker 2
Yes, yes, that's what they do.
[00:03:17.350] - Speaker 1
Or go straight to Gerardo, Ibagué, Espinal, Miriam, Rada.
[00:03:22.700] - Speaker 2
Yes, they're sending us there. Yes, miss.
[00:03:25.050] - Speaker 1
And tonics are not recommended, because the blood needs to circulate.
[00:03:34.400] - Speaker 2
It's the opposite, okay.
[00:03:37.300] - Speaker 1
Yes, that's what information is. There you go, miss. But thank you very much.
[00:03:43.400] - Speaker 2
But thank you very much, Reza.
