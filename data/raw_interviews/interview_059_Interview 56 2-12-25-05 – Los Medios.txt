And how many years have you lived in El Carmen?
[00:00:20.520] - Speaker 2
All my life.
[00:00:23.290] - Speaker 3
And do you think it's likely you'll get bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:28.290] - Speaker 2
You think what?
[00:00:29.530] - Speaker 3
Do you think it's likely that you'll be bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:33.710] - Speaker 2
That it does bite. Of course.
[00:00:36.480] - Speaker 3
Why?
[00:00:39.640] - Speaker 2
Well, if you go out or step on it or whatever, or it's lying around somewhere, it bites you. You go out in the dark, you touch it, you step on it, it bites. Obviously.
[00:00:54.580] - Speaker 3
And have any of your animals been killed by a snake?
[00:00:59.180] - Speaker 2
No, not even if God himself forbid it. Not so far, no. Nobody.
[00:01:05.230] - Speaker 3
And do you know how to prevent snakebite?
[00:01:09.980] - Speaker 2
I've heard that the hunters keep the gall, that they say that's what it's for. And the antidote, fly to the village, to the health center, so they can give you the antidote. Yes. And people, if they don't go, they die because there have been cases like that around here.
[00:01:36.300] - Speaker 3
And before a snake question, do you know how to avoid a snakebite?
[00:01:44.130] - Speaker 2
No, no What's it called? Not suddenly exposing yourself to the risk of being bitten by that animal or going to mess around down there, because they're down there in the ugly stuff, in the... Well, don't go messing around down there.
[00:02:04.990] - Speaker 3
And what would you do if you were bitten by a snake?
[00:02:08.610] - Speaker 2
What wouldn't I do? Well, run, call for help and the safest thing they say is to tie yourself up, make a cross cut, let the blood flow and fly for- Or make a tourniquet. Yes, make a tourniquet so that the poison doesn't rise.
[00:02:30.700] - Speaker 3
And would you trust the hospital, the Carmen, to cure a snake bite?
[00:02:37.530] - Speaker 2
How much what?
[00:02:38.270] - Speaker 3
I don't know if you would trust them. Would you trust them at the hospital, at the Carmen?
[00:02:41.150] - Speaker 2
No, not here, in this hospital. No, it's just very bad luck Why? No, they don't treat that.
[00:02:49.000] - Speaker 4
Don't they give you first aid quickly? Because with a snake you have to be quick, there, to get them to attend to you, but you arrive and
[00:02:58.790] - Speaker 2
Not here, those who are
[00:03:00.120] - Speaker 4
You die there until you get angry.
[00:03:03.280] - Speaker 2
Not for that. If people have died who have been treated with them, for example, when there's been that piritonitis, perectonitis, and they have to operate or cut it open, well, man, throw it lightly somewhere else, if they can't do it there, if there aren't the resources to operate on it. But people have died there. And according to that, I understand that the front end of each snake is different. Uh-huh, that.
[00:03:29.330] - Speaker 1
So, if you don't have it, you have to look for it.
[00:03:36.730] - Speaker 3
And would you trust other nearby hospitals, Carmen?
[00:03:40.650] - Speaker 2
Well, suddenly, now, for example, Girardot or Bogotá or Ibagué, they are already more advanced hospitals, they have things at hand. To say something they go there, that no, because the equipment was damaged, they cannot operate.
[00:04:02.470] - Speaker 3
Yes.
[00:04:03.860] - Speaker 2
So.
[00:04:06.430] - Speaker 3
And where do you feel it is more likely that you will be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:04:14.880] - Speaker 2
that a snake is dying?
[00:04:16.850] - Speaker 3
Where are you most likely to be bitten by a snake?
[00:04:20.460] - Speaker 2
That it moves.
[00:04:21.680] - Speaker 1
No, he's going to get bitten.
[00:04:23.570] - Speaker 2
In the countryside. In the countryside, yes. Although there are also Well, you have to be careful, because in the city, in the village there are also some. No, but more in the countryside. Yes, in the countryside. Look, a case, there's the lady from Guareque, in the village, there's a house in the village, that's it. And one day a snake in the whole window, in the clean one. And a snake there in the window? Yes. How awful. So, you have to be careful wherever you are. Yes.
[00:05:04.990] - Speaker 3
And can you identify poisonous snakes or non-poisonous ones?
[00:05:10.150] - Speaker 2
What does serpientes venenosas mean?
[00:05:13.110] - Speaker 3
Can you recognize yourself?
[00:05:14.790] - Speaker 2
Identify them. And don't you identify them? Yes, identify them when you see them. Well, I know some. I know some, for example, the sizes that have the X. For example, the coral, which are colorful. And, for example, the green ones, which are the bejucas they call. For example, some brown ones that are pure brown are the havaneras. And some that are sparkly, they are the toches, they say, or granadillas, which are also very dark. Yes, otherwise no. And the cascabel, because of those little things that those ones make.
[00:06:02.560] - Speaker 3
And do you know of a case of a tough female snake?
[00:06:09.250] - Speaker 2
No, no, no. Not around here, no. But I have heard that here in the neighborhood, around here, from here up, over there, as it is big, it is a lot, over there, over there someone has died. And around here, a lady died. And the bull too, a lady died. It killed her. She killed her, she murdered her, the woman who didn't go until the next day and the poison had already taken effect.
[00:06:38.240] - Speaker 4
Here in the farm, a man also spent an afternoon looking at the cattle. And he was looking at the cattle and it got to be night, and when it was night, he felt that What he did was to kick it, but not... And when he came back, he said to the woman: Oh, something stung me. And he looked, of course, it had stung him and there was the carving, it was on his leg and...
[00:07:08.730] - Speaker 2
Of course, because that catches cangrinas, it catches That comes loose. That gets very ugly where one of those animals bites. My God, I can't stop and it doesn't look good. Around here they say there's plenty. Here, in this pasture, here and there, the caretaker who was here said that he had killed a certain number of those animals he was mowing, he said: Those go out there in the house, in the house. I wouldn't go over there even if it were true. I too have found them all mown down, found tall ones.
[00:07:43.890] - Speaker 4
Well, there, when you find them with the rope and the piece comes out. But there, near the carme.
[00:07:53.120] - Speaker 2
Because we are very careful, because there are a lot of rattlesnakes over there. Over here, in these parts, there are lots of rattlesnakes. And in the little savannas, in the little hills of those savannas, because they like to make you where it is flat as well as savanna.
[00:08:13.820] - Speaker 3
Well, I have no more questions, but you have more to say about snakes or your knowledge of them.
[00:08:20.960] - Speaker 2
Well, that's what it gave me in all the years I've been here. And we've been where there have been plenty of those animals, but thank God and blessed be the Lord, never. Well, one is cautious. Thank God.
[00:08:37.500] - Speaker 1
Are you sure that when you get stung, you have to suck it, open yourself up and suck the slit and suck the blood and throw it away? In other words, it makes you want to get the poison out.
[00:08:53.500] - Speaker 3
Yes. It is recommended in the case of a snakebite. First, stay calm, because the blood can flow faster if you panic. And it is also not recommended to use a tourniquet because the blood needs to circulate.
[00:09:22.540] - Speaker 2
No.
[00:09:24.180] - Speaker 3
What? If you get a tourniquet, you could lose an arm. A limb. Yes, exactly. And it's important to go straight to the hospital. And it's true, the hospital in El Carmen often doesn't have a physicist.
[00:09:49.670] - Speaker 2
He has to get him from somewhere else.
[00:09:51.620] - Speaker 3
Yes, rotated, spinal, blurred, tolimaida.
[00:09:57.500] - Speaker 2
Yes.
[00:09:59.250] - Speaker 3
But yes. And it's also important to know which snake is moving, because there are different antidotes.
[00:10:09.530] - Speaker 1
Of course. That way we can help them avoid that problem.
[00:10:14.340] - Speaker 2
For example, they say the snake's bite, the coral. They say there is no antidote. Well, I don't know what the truth was. Yes.
[00:10:25.910] - Speaker 3
Well, that's it. Thank you very much. Who else would like to say something? Ready? Okay, thank you very much.
[00:10:35.340] - Speaker 1
The butlers, when you find them, why do they say that they can't be killed?
[00:10:42.430] - Speaker 3
You can kill poisonous snakes.
[00:10:46.840] - Speaker 2
And if you die from a snake bite, it is important to know which snake it was, so you can kill it and take it to the hospital.
[00:11:00.400] - Speaker 1
What? Science? They are also protected by environmentalists, there are some who protect them. Yes. So, there are others who don't.
[00:11:13.400] - Speaker 3
Maybe, yes. But you don't need to kill the non-poisonous snakes, because the non-poisonous snakes maintain the population of poisonous snakes, you know what I mean? But it's difficult, of course, to know which snakes are poisonous and which are not. What?
[00:11:40.380] - Speaker 2
How can you do it? You just see one of those creatures and, my goodness, you pay for it.
[00:11:48.930] - Speaker 3
But thank you very much, Micho.
[00:11:53.650] - Speaker 2
Well, always in order.
