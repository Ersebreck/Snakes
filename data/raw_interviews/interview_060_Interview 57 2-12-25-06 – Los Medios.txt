Tensioned.

Divorced. Widowed.
[00:00:27.070] - Speaker 2
And how many years have you lived in El Carmen?
[00:00:30.300] - Speaker 1
22.
[00:00:32.570] - Speaker 2
And do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here, in El Carmen?
[00:00:38.420] - Speaker 1
Everything is probable in this life. It's not for effect. Everything is probable. Yes, why is it probable? Because, for example, when my old lady was alive, there were the two of us here and she came out of the bathroom after a bath and a snake came in here, straight towards her. Believe me, a size X. And she was already scared and couldn't speak, she got stuck and climbed onto a bed there and made me do this and I didn't understand her very well. And finally I looked down, of course, there goes the size. She had a machete that would fill your head. So, all that is active and most likely.
[00:01:26.520] - Speaker 2
Yes, exactly, of course. Any animals of yours? And you haven't been bitten by a snake? No. And do you know how to prevent or avoid a snakebite? No. And what would you do if you were bitten by a snake?
[00:01:43.790] - Speaker 1
Go to the hospital. Which hospital? El Carmen de Aticalada.
[00:01:48.900] - Speaker 2
And would you trust the hospital, in El Carmen, to cure a snakebite? Would you trust the hospital, in El Carmen, to cure a snakebite? Well, so-so.
[00:01:59.640] - Speaker 1
Not much.
[00:02:01.650] - Speaker 2
Why?
[00:02:03.690] - Speaker 1
Because there is no specialized service for that. They don't have the tools to work with. I'm telling you because my wife got sick and I took her to the emergency room at the Carmen de Aticalada hospital. I don't remember what appendicitis, appendix, no, well, something like that. And there was nothing there, the doctor there is from the province. And then they called everywhere because there is no Girardón here, nothing because being Tolima, Girardón is in Cundinamarca. And even though I had it affiliated, and I was affiliated in Girardón to the 9PS. New service, urgent, she was about to die already. I told the doctor: I'm taking her no matter what. He said: You take her under your responsibility, sign for her. I said: Yes, I'll take her. And I took her to Girardón, up the hill, what's it called? I've forgotten right now. To San Sebastián? To San Sebastián. And there they had a connection with the EPS where they received her and one night they operated on her because she was about to die.
[00:03:33.744] - Speaker 1
Well, I don't really trust that. Yes, of course. For example, I had an accident just this June last year. Look, the sample. I was on a motorbike and it crashed into me head-on.
[00:03:50.020] - Speaker 1
I went down and then up again. It almost killed me there. And then, nothing at all. Where did I go? Where?
[00:04:03.860] - Speaker 2
The orthopedist or something, he told me: I went crazy.
[00:04:08.270] - Speaker 1
They asked me to the clinic. And they gave it and wrote: We don't have the tools to work with, there was nothing to do the exam with, so I couldn't, you don't trust it, I don't trust it much there. There you can see how it's useless.
[00:04:26.740] - Speaker 2
I understand, yes.
[00:04:28.460] - Speaker 1
The truth is And to cure or to be curing a snakebite, would you trust other hospitals? Of course.
[00:04:41.290] - Speaker 2
Do I bring closer or?
[00:04:42.370] - Speaker 1
For example, it has happened to me, because I have high blood pressure and I had to go to Girardot, because there, for example, since I had to go, they didn't have the device for What is it called? To take one's blood pressure.
[00:05:06.210] - Speaker 2
Yes, a pacemaker. They didn't have that device.
[00:05:11.060] - Speaker 1
For me it's less than a hygiene center. I go to Flanders, I go to Flanders to the hygiene center, it's much better than the Carmen de Atucalá hospital, hygiene center.
[00:05:29.850] - Speaker 2
And where do you feel it is more likely that you will be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:05:37.970] - Speaker 1
Well, what I'm saying is that anything is possible. You can't escape these things.
[00:05:44.790] - Speaker 2
Yes, of course.
[00:05:45.990] - Speaker 1
That she knows that animals, bugs, appear anywhere. Yes, in general. For example, the flying snake or bejuca, as they call it, which she doesn't. It's not dangerous, but around here once she had a kitten, she killed it there. And here in this tree there was another one, quite big, and it fell to the ground, the cat ran it over there too. But those that are not dangerous. In here, she had her cage with some little birds in it, I sell gas, there are some cylinders. I went to a cylinder to sell something, there was one coiled up there, but a hunter, which is not dangerous either. And so it can be. A few days ago, moving those bushes, there was another one coiled up there. But it probably wasn't I don't know much about snakes, but it probably wasn't very dangerous either, because it left. They've caught you soon enough. But anything is possible.
[00:07:00.940] - Speaker 2
Great. And can you identify poisonous snakes or non-venomous ones? What? Can you identify poisonous snakes or non-venomous ones?
[00:07:11.420] - Speaker 1
That I know.
[00:07:12.830] - Speaker 2
Can you recognize yourself? Can you recognize snakes?
[00:07:20.030] - Speaker 1
I don't understand you very well. The audio is very low.
[00:07:23.130] - Speaker 2
No problem.
[00:07:23.740] - Speaker 1
He talks to me and I hardly understand.
[00:07:26.870] - Speaker 2
Can you identify snakes as being poisonous snakes or non-poisonous snakes?
[00:07:32.740] - Speaker 1
Yes, for example, size and size X, because there are two kinds of sizes. The coral. I think the rotter too, that a snake is called a rotter, that it bites and rots, not poisons.
[00:07:55.430] - Speaker 2
And how can we identify the snakes?
[00:08:00.760] - Speaker 1
How can it be identified?
[00:08:02.790] - Speaker 2
The ID card. Okay, ready. And do you know of a case of a snake moreduda? Do you know of a case of a snake moreduda?
[00:08:17.290] - Speaker 1
What did you want?
[00:08:18.880] - Speaker 2
Do you know of a case?
[00:08:24.100] - Speaker 1
Here, for example, Pedro's wife. But she told me that it bit her when she was going past the paddock, something.
[00:08:35.930] - Speaker 2
In the countryside?
[00:08:38.740] - Speaker 1
Yes, reaching a ravine. Sure, possibly, the dog that arrives with the dogs in front passed by and it rolled, it rolled, the dogs passed by and the puppy rolled, it was passing by and it bit her, it almost killed her too. The corral that is already ringed, that one told him how it is, I already told him.
[00:09:02.260] - Speaker 2
Yes, okay.
[00:09:03.160] - Speaker 1
Various colors, ring binder, cover.
[00:09:11.320] - Speaker 2
That's it, I have no more questions. Is there anything else you want to say about being your patients or your knowledge? No. Nothing else? No. Okay. Thank you very much. It's important to go straight to the hospital.
[00:09:23.900] - Speaker 1
I was going to ask you, with which case, reason or company, or from where, or how, and where to?
[00:09:33.640] - Speaker 2
I work with Which company do you work for? Me?
[00:09:41.730] - Speaker 1

[00:09:44.610] - Speaker 2
No, with the Universidad de los Andes.
[00:09:48.260] - Speaker 1
Yeah. It's good.
[00:09:53.030] - Speaker 2

[00:09:57.420] - Speaker 2
Yes.
[00:09:58.280] - Speaker 1
