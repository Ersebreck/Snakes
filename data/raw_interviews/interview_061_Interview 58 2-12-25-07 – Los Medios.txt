Man, administrator, free union, lived in Carmen for 5 years
[00:00:00.680] - Speaker 3
What is your name?
[00:00:02.380] - Speaker 2
José Fernando Ortiz Daza.
[00:00:04.320] - Speaker 3
And what do you do for a living?
[00:00:06.560] - Speaker 2
As an administrator.
[00:00:08.500] - Speaker 3
And are you married or single?
[00:00:11.360] - Speaker 1
Free union.
[00:00:12.860] - Speaker 3
And how many years have you lived in El Carmen?
[00:00:17.340] - Speaker 2
Five.
[00:00:19.080] - Speaker 3
And do you think it's likely that you'll be bitten by a snake here in El Carmen?
[00:00:25.100] - Speaker 2
Well, trusting in God, never. Because I'm always very I'm very on it, I'm on it. Of course. At night, I go hunting, instead of the other time, when I went hunting at night, I used to When I was more active, I used to go at night and I never, never... I never liked it. Thank God, it never happened to me.
[00:00:47.970] - Speaker 1
No.
[00:00:49.260] - Speaker 3
Why not?
[00:00:50.500] - Speaker 1
Well, I say no, because one is forearmed.
[00:00:53.610] - Speaker 2
You have to be on your guard, always on your toes when you're in the country Being in the countryside all your life, well, you have to be on your guard. I've been in the countryside for, imagine, over fifty years and even when I was walking around I never...
[00:01:07.700] - Speaker 1
Like me, digging around in the garden up there, you see with your hand, I look first, I do it with a stick like this, I see if there's a snake or not. I don't stick my hand in there, but I look to see if I need to dig in the garden, that is, to scare it off.
[00:01:24.930] - Speaker 3
And have any of your animals been bitten by a snake? Your cows, yes?
[00:01:30.670] - Speaker 2
The cows.
[00:01:31.750] - Speaker 3
And what happened to the cows?
[00:01:33.860] - Speaker 2
They die. They die and They died. The pimps are the ones who take advantage of them, because when you can't see, you can't dance, you can't see how you're going to take advantage of her.
[00:01:42.720] - Speaker 3
An adult and a baby too.
[00:01:45.630] - Speaker 2
An adult and a calf, yes.
[00:01:49.060] - Speaker 3
With the same snake? Well, in that case You never know.
[00:01:54.780] - Speaker 2
Different, yes, because one doesn't know if it was the same, if it was another, because
[00:01:58.300] - Speaker 3
Yes, yes, yes.
[00:02:00.360] - Speaker 2
Yes, of course.
[00:02:00.960] - Speaker 3
And do you know how to prevent a snakebite or avoid a snakebite?
[00:02:08.950] - Speaker 2
Practically, I have no idea, because it has never happened to me, I have no idea how to prevent it. We have seen cases that take them to the hospital. Yes, of course, because you have seen other cases like that.
[00:02:22.060] - Speaker 1
When they have the medicine there, they cure them and they can't let the patient die.
[00:02:25.460] - Speaker 2
Yes, I have seen cases like that.
[00:02:27.090] - Speaker 3
And before a snakebite, do you know how to avoid a bite? How to prevent it? Yes. No, right?
[00:02:34.760] - Speaker 2
No. No, I don't. I have no idea how to prevent it, because you say how.
[00:02:42.750] - Speaker 3
Okay.
[00:02:42.840] - Speaker 2
It doesn't say how. That is to say, avoid it because one I mean, I say that a bull, a snake, bites you because you provoke it, because you touch it. It's just that she gets angry. At least one of the cattle suddenly steps on her, that's when she lashes out. Or suddenly, when they are already being bullied, she is in her place, the animal passes her and suddenly, as the animal has four limbs, with the tail she wakes it up and she gets to the point where with the tail it arrives and... That's when she bites it, because with the dialect she moves it, it wakes up and then it comes and attacks. When she sees that it's about to happen, the last one arrives and... That's when she pulls it When the press pulls the animal. Or many times it goes eating and of course, the animal goes eating, it goes grazing, it goes grazing. And she sees the movement and will say: No, it is stealing from me.
[00:03:45.566] - Speaker 2
That's when she arrives and sends it the claw and bites its nose. Or the nose, the laws said, when it is already in the press, well the animal, that's when the animal bites it, yes.
[00:03:59.670] - Speaker 3
And what would you do if you were bitten by a snake?
[00:04:06.480] - Speaker 2
Well, in that case the only thing to do is to run to the doctor, because what else? Call or something, someone, well.
[00:04:13.030] - Speaker 1
Quickly to the hospital, if there's a way to get him out, of course.
[00:04:16.660] - Speaker 2
To go for a walk, yes. Because you're often a long way from home. So what do you do? You either run, or if you don't have time At the moment if there's no phone, or if you can get a phone, but there's no signal.
[00:04:32.460] - Speaker 1
Here I can see that there is a signal on one phone, but not on the other. Yes, exactly.
[00:04:36.440] - Speaker 2
Run home and warn them.
[00:04:40.670] - Speaker 3
And all the time you have transportation to go to the hospital, if necessary.
[00:04:46.140] - Speaker 1
Well, the moped, the motorbike or the neighbors, the neighbors in anything, because I don't know how to drive.
[00:04:53.640] - Speaker 3
The neighbors, yes.
[00:04:55.230] - Speaker 2
All of a sudden, a neighbor who has to move one at that moment, if one If you feel capable, if you have to mobilize, then get going. It's the only one.
[00:05:07.190] - Speaker 3
And would you trust the hospital, the Carmen, to cure a snakebite?
[00:05:13.110] - Speaker 1
No.
[00:05:13.750] - Speaker 2
Why? I don't know, because I don't know if they have first aid there. Well, maybe they do have first aid, right? But maybe they don't have
[00:05:24.470] - Speaker 1
They're not sending him to Ibaguen or El Espinal, are they?
[00:05:26.530] - Speaker 2
Don't they have the
[00:05:27.120] - Speaker 1
No, for the spinal, for Ibaguen.
[00:05:29.160] - Speaker 4
The Ahorita guys, they're already there in bed.
[00:05:32.260] - Speaker 1
I think so, because around here There is, right now there is. How can you not know?
[00:05:36.320] - Speaker 2
Suddenly, because there are always snakes, there is always something to do.
[00:05:39.710] - Speaker 4
I have it, because one of my sisters got stung by one and now there are more.
[00:05:43.950] - Speaker 2
Well, better. Because when you go to the hospital a little, you don't know about all those things. Yes, that's the thing.
[00:05:54.220] - Speaker 3
And where do you feel it is more likely that you will be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or in the house?
[00:06:03.010] - Speaker 2
In the country, because one, well, there's always one, at least, it's very different from a whore coming to your bed or your house. And some people have had that happen to them, finding the whore in their bed. Because I've heard that comment, that she's not in the bed, I don't know what. And I say: How?
[00:06:24.370] - Speaker 1
Yes, but that's in the past.
[00:06:26.180] - Speaker 3
But it's all a bit sudden
[00:06:29.240] - Speaker 2
What happened?
[00:06:30.490] - Speaker 1
No, that you never see one, and you always see them around.
[00:06:34.840] - Speaker 2
But for me, always, I haven't found much there in the house
[00:06:38.490] - Speaker 1
But more on the feet. Yes. More on the feet. Yes, exactly.
[00:06:41.730] - Speaker 2
The bitch, one bites you on the foot, because well If one were to use four words, one bites you on the arm or the face, always on the feet.
[00:06:52.220] - Speaker 3
Can you identify poisonous snakes or non-poisonous ones?
[00:07:00.060] - Speaker 2
The only ones I know are the boa constrictor, the rattlesnake and the coral snake, which I'm told are the most dangerous snakes there are.
[00:07:13.820] - Speaker 3
And how are these snakes going to identify themselves?
[00:07:20.020] - Speaker 2
Almost the rattlesnake, because she knows one by the sound of the rattles. And the size, she knows one by the Xs it carries. And the coral, by the red and black.
[00:07:38.170] - Speaker 1
Red and white, because sometimes it's white and sometimes it's black. So that's how it was.
[00:07:43.530] - Speaker 2
It's just that because it's also there that the
[00:07:47.190] - Speaker 1
Because there is one in black and white and another in red and black.
[00:07:49.870] - Speaker 2
Supposedly, they say that there is the rabodeaji, the rabodeaji there, right? The rabodeaji there, also that there is no Like seeing one there when he is more mature.
[00:07:57.730] - Speaker 1
No, you take one, don't you?
[00:07:59.480] - Speaker 3
No, that's fine, thank you.
[00:08:02.040] - Speaker 2
Thank you. That one, yes.
[00:08:04.200] - Speaker 3
Okay. And do you know of a case of a snakebite?
[00:08:11.160] - Speaker 1
Sure. Yes, a neighbor who died. The owl was wrong, of course, in size.
[00:08:19.040] - Speaker 3
He left for the countryside.
[00:08:21.580] - Speaker 2
Sure. I mean, it bit him, they were fishing in the river and on the riverbank, making a blind, he arrived and they went over there to search, there was the snake, he arrived and
[00:08:36.060] - Speaker 1
Known to us.
[00:08:38.300] - Speaker 2
He bit his head off.
[00:08:39.100] - Speaker 1
That's what it became. In the hospital, his head was like that.
[00:08:43.140] - Speaker 3
And he went to the hospital? Yes, of course.
[00:08:46.520] - Speaker 2
But no, not that. Well, I mean, the brain is difficult, because the brain is biting, it's a monster. How mean. Because it's one thing: Who's going to put a tourniquet on your shoulder? Well, you die, because now how are you going to tighten it there. So, of course, he hit him here in the head.
[00:09:08.010] - Speaker 3
How sad, yes.
[00:09:09.870] - Speaker 2
They killed her there, because when he felt the blow to the head, the kid was young, the guy was like 25 years old, man. And then, the others realized that of course, when he felt the blow to the back of the head, the other friends started to look, of course, there was the daughter of a mother, she was like this thick. They killed her there.
[00:09:32.850] - Speaker 1
That you feel so low that you lose it there.
[00:09:37.100] - Speaker 2
Sure, because since she has two dicks, they do it like that. No, yeah.
[00:09:42.350] - Speaker 1
That we have certainly experienced.
[00:09:44.230] - Speaker 2
The boy already died from that.
[00:09:47.310] - Speaker 4
Tulio, wasn't it that there were also two from where you come from at one time? Don't you remember that there were two snake charmers?
[00:09:53.710] - Speaker 2
They also call you a friend, a sardino. That's it, the kid, he's like in his twenties, I think. El Chunquito, does the son of the woman upstairs in Santa Rita remember him? The son of the woman from all over Chunco also bit him because he was carrying a culera and he bit his foot.
[00:10:07.010] - Speaker 1
Yes, of course. But of course, he was a kid. They blamed this on him here.
[00:10:13.370] - Speaker 2
They charged him for a bribe, a kickback, a cut.
[00:10:15.120] - Speaker 1
But it wasn't the same. No, sir, it was a rotting one. Of course, because he got an infection, he got it, he got it, he got it, he got it. No, out, yes, either you heal or you get saved or you die. But it was the rotting one and they blamed the little girl. But as a child, and now today he is a man. Of course, and now he is on crutches.
[00:10:36.940] - Speaker 2
Now they put the little foot here on the knee so it's short. The dog.
[00:10:41.690] - Speaker 1
The rotten one. She's eating something, it sounds. That one. It's a blender, have you heard of it, you bastard? Yes, yes, yes. So, you get stung and he starts the I don't know if there's a cure for it, but I really don't know. No, she doesn't sting, she bites. But I really don't know.
[00:10:55.780] - Speaker 2
She doesn't just sting, she bites. So, she comes to bite I don't know anymore.
[00:10:59.630] - Speaker 1
Of course, I don't know, Mrs. Luz, if you will have that, Father.
[00:11:02.900] - Speaker 2
Your body rots. No, she does have a cure, because they have to cut it up. Because where they leave it there, it eats it until it kills it. Because she rots it little by little, until they arrive and kill it.
[00:11:15.530] - Speaker 4
Hey, what snake bit Ramón Romero when they cut his whole leg? I don't know, yes, I think it was a pit viper too. Yes, it bit him on one foot and they cut him up to here so they could They cut him like this, all the way up.
[00:11:31.190] - Speaker 2
I've heard that when you bite it by a size, that you barely bite it to get a knife, whatever, or cut yourself crosswise, breaking where you bit it, so that the blood comes out. But at one point you do have to specialise in pulling it out for the hospital.
[00:11:50.290] - Speaker 1
And you don't go armed.
[00:11:52.480] - Speaker 2
Because blood is also involved, it dies, because the blood That is, because the poison then enters the blood, until it reaches the heart and causes it to infarct and die or become inflamed.
[00:12:03.350] - Speaker 1
Then you cut it there and you slit it, then the blood comes out and that's it.
[00:12:11.180] - Speaker 2
And you can save yourself, but if you're not far from the hospital, blood dies.
[00:12:17.480] - Speaker 3
And have you also seen a size X in your bathroom recently? Yes?
[00:12:25.510] - Speaker 2
I've never found it around here.
[00:12:27.940] - Speaker 3
I've never seen it here. I thought, you said that before the interview, didn't you? No, not here. What size?
[00:12:36.030] - Speaker 2
talla X, in the bathroom. Which X?
[00:12:37.970] - Speaker 4
What is it?
[00:12:38.500] - Speaker 2
Well, the brave one.
[00:12:40.260] - Speaker 4
Does that one sound familiar to you?
[00:12:43.730] - Speaker 2
No, because they sound the same. Jingle. They are just similar.
[00:12:46.960] - Speaker 1
They're just two little ones, Mrs. Luz.
[00:12:48.650] - Speaker 2
The rattlesnake and the carving are similar, right? But no. But no. But they're not the same color. But the rattlesnake is shinier, the skin is prettier.
[00:12:59.330] - Speaker 1
I guess there's no talla here that there's talla here that Yes, two have been killed here.
[00:13:03.010] - Speaker 4
Yes? Here? Haven't you noticed?
[00:13:04.840] - Speaker 2
They killed one here that had What do you mean they killed her there? I took you all there.
[00:13:07.730] - Speaker 4
There were There were... How many? There were 11. And here they killed the female, here there were seven. When they lit the fire over there, that ridge, they came the only time. They say that in the history of the people here, because I'm not from here, the people here say that they had never seen and those two were killed here, but big catches, right, Tulio?
[00:13:27.750] - Speaker 1
Yes, two. Yes.
[00:13:31.560] - Speaker 3
And, well, I have no more questions, but you have more to say about snakes or your knowledge of them.
[00:13:41.900] - Speaker 2
No, well, well. I mean, all the ones I know, at least the guío, which is similar to the talla, which eats the chickens, well, also that it is rooted instead of the talla. Because once upon a time I had a case with a guío, it almost took my foot off, it was carried by a guío about this thick. A friend took it to skin it, right? Over many years. And he took it to be slaughtered. And at that moment the bastard, already dying, I mean, I said: No, it's already dead. So, I went and changed my boots, I went and put on my sandals. At that time we used the apargate as a flip-flop, just like that. And I went to look at him, and I went over there and signaled with my foot to see if he was dead. When I said that he came and he  He gave me that slap. Then, with the mallet that the guy had there to hit him with the club so he would die, then I came and hit him with the mallet.
[00:14:49.737] - Speaker 2
Then, when he died, we came and opened his face. He had both his gums there, they were leaking a yellow liquid.
[00:14:59.790] - Speaker 2
Then, And I said: This man is crazy, and I said: See, almost.
[00:15:02.910] - Speaker 1
Sure, where does one bite the bullet?
[00:15:04.060] - Speaker 2
That where my foot gets caught, it makes me jump, imagine. And from there, where we were for Carmen or for Melgar, imagine, about four hours' walk, it was on a farm, who would have thought it, it was like being an animal, getting out on the road or calling to see who was coming to pick you up. That's when I realized and I scolded Guido for that. For that reason, when I saw him we peeled him when they both come out like that, that yellow liquid was coming out. He said to himself: Wow, like that, and that liquid was coming out like that at the tip of the horn like that. I said: How's that? It caught my foot. He managed to catch me. When I saw that he moved and I thought, "What about me?" He managed to catch someone. I braced myself, I managed to catch myself, then when I saw that he moved and did that, I managed to catch myself, I braced myself, the poison came out and we're going to tip over.
[00:16:03.140] - Speaker 3
There. Those are the bad ones.
[00:16:07.180] - Speaker 2
Done.
[00:16:08.640] - Speaker 3
Thank you very much. It is important to go directly to the hospital after a snakebite. Turnstiles are not recommended.
[00:16:21.710] - Speaker 1
In other words, the recommendation of this interview, what recommendation do you give us if we get bitten by a snake?
[00:16:28.520] - Speaker 3
They go straight to the hospital. And in El Carmen there is often no anaesthesiologist, it is more important to go to Girardón, Espinada. Carmen is not there.
[00:16:40.230] - Speaker 1
I'll say it. Yes, ma'am. Yes, we don't have to send him over there.
[00:16:44.450] - Speaker 2
No, because it's that Well, I mean, when you suddenly arrive at a picaresque asshole, they call, then they send you immediately.
[00:16:52.670] - Speaker 1
I think the friend we call Juan Girardón died, Omar, they called him the owl, I think he died over there, that No, I didn't think that there
[00:17:00.890] - Speaker 2
After one of those mincers it's already difficult, it's already difficult for them to do whatever they do.
[00:17:07.070] - Speaker 4
That they have to know which one bit them, it's essential to know which one it was, because then they don't know either, then nothing is done.
[00:17:14.840] - Speaker 2
But, Mr. Aluja, it's already difficult, imagine, from Cunday to the river, to the river Cunday. And they told him: No, they said it's a water snake, I don't know what it's called. No, not that. One of those animals, when the other one reports it, the poison spreads very quickly. And by the time they took him, imagine, from the field to the hospital, about 2 hours until they reached Cunday, and from there to be sent there, there was no time. By the time he got there, he was already in a bad way, he was already on his last legs.
[00:17:48.440] - Speaker 1
And what other recommendations do they give us?
[00:17:50.760] - Speaker 3
Yes, go straight to the hospital. That's the most important information.
[00:17:57.370] - Speaker 2
In other words, we always And for us always anything always the important thing is to get there and become a tourniquet?
[00:18:07.240] - Speaker 3
No, it is not advisable, because blood needs to circulate and you can ask for an extremity if you make a tourniquet.
[00:18:22.220] - Speaker 2
At least when you cut yourself, when you get to it, you cut yourself, imagine. It's not recommended, yes. But you know what And here's hoping the hospital arrives, they give blood. And here's hoping the hospital arrives, well it's one of those oaths, the person, you make a tourniquet, you tie it so that the blood doesn't come out so quickly.
[00:18:40.600] - Speaker 1
Do you know what I do when I cut my finger? Because you know that in the kitchen I always, at any moment, all of a sudden Well, I pinch my finger a little and, once, I pinched it a little there for a while. But it always has to be pinched so that it doesn't come out, because if I take my finger out, it comes out.
[00:19:00.430] - Speaker 2
A friend of ours saw us once, we were working in a rocery, a friend fucked up with a chainsaw, you know, cutting wood, right? And he came and knocked the stick over and it turned out that a stick fell on him, he came and whack, it hit the chainsaw on top of the chain and hit him here on the sole of his boot and opened up the whole thing like this. Holy cow, sir, he fell with the chainsaw still attached, he came: What did we do, the guys? They took off his shirt, tied him up and pressed down on all that there, put a tourniquet on his leg here. Imagine, a distance away in a rockery, going down some slopes that
[00:19:47.160] - Speaker 1
That was one of the things from before, I don't know how now
[00:19:50.040] - Speaker 2
And the man who screwed up his knee, he walks all right, but
[00:19:53.750] - Speaker 3
Yes, interesting.
[00:19:54.780] - Speaker 2
Therapy, the man recovered from his knee, but imagine, calling, coming to the field later, to Cundá, and that lasts about three hours. Calling a friend, sending a kid ahead, a young kid guy, Mano, go do such and such a part. The only part on a farm had a tractor. It was the only tractor in that sector. We sent the kid ahead and we could carry that man by lowering him to Oh, my goodness, with his knee, I can't turn around, lower him and he would get off on his ass putting the handles on to carry him on his shoulder, don't let it be any more... With his legs up in the air and he would get off on his ass putting the handles on until he reached the bottom, where we could put him back in the hammock and get him there. And we got down to the plan and the kid went there, when the tractor came, we put him on the tractor and to the hospital in Kundai.
[00:20:52.576] - Speaker 2
And from there in Kundai, they put him in the spinal, that day. And from there from the hospital, and no, man touched man's half the...
[00:21:01.570] - Speaker 1
And just now when they went up, were they all the way up?
[00:21:03.410] - Speaker 2
How could those from the
[00:21:05.350] - Speaker 1
Yes. They're going up there now. Yes.
[00:21:09.240] - Speaker 2
