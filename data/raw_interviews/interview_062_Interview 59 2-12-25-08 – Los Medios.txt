What is your name?
[00:00:01.060] - Speaker 1
Luz Elida Arias.
[00:00:03.490] - Speaker 2
And how old are you?
[00:00:05.300] - Speaker 1
70 years.
[00:00:06.930] - Speaker 2
And what do you do? On Mondays. Of course. And are you married or single?
[00:00:13.130] - Speaker 1
Yes, married and separated.
[00:00:15.780] - Speaker 2
And how many years have you lived in Carben?
[00:00:19.250] - Speaker 1
I've been here for 16 years, I'm not from here.
[00:00:24.790] - Speaker 2
Where are you?
[00:00:25.720] - Speaker 1
I am from Tindío.
[00:00:27.480] - Speaker 2
And so, do you think it's likely that a snake will kill you here? No. Why?
[00:00:34.150] - Speaker 1
No, because I'm very careful and I keep spraying with specific products and I'm very cautious. Never in 16 years, never, never, never, never, never. But in El Carmen it's likely. Yes, in the forest, yes. And not even then, because I go fishing a lot, I really like it, and I go everywhere and never. So, I keep a very close eye on things.
[00:00:59.620] - Speaker 2
And has any animal of yours ever been bitten by a snake? No, nothing. And do you know how to prevent a snakebite? No. Before a bite, you don't know? No. And what would you do if you were bitten by a snake?
[00:01:18.280] - Speaker 1
Immediately a doctor.
[00:01:19.400] - Speaker 2
In the Carmen neighborhood or where?
[00:01:22.150] - Speaker 1
I think that if I said that there had to be that in Carmen, I think I would immediately seek medical attention.
[00:01:27.390] - Speaker 2
Would you trust the Hospital del Carmen to cure you? Of course I would.
[00:01:29.960] - Speaker 1
Yes, because a sister of mine got bitten there and now one day, they saved her.
[00:01:37.910] - Speaker 2
And would you trust other hospitals too?
[00:01:40.440] - Speaker 1
Yes, that too. For me, any hospital is good for studying. To study doctors, that's what doctors studied for.
[00:01:48.990] - Speaker 2
And where do you feel it is more likely that you will be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:01:55.660] - Speaker 1
In the countryside, in the mountains. Of course, in the mountains. Why? Because they are from the mountains, they keep to the mountains.
[00:02:02.640] - Speaker 2
And can you tell whether a snake is poisonous or not? No, I don't know anything. Ready? It's difficult.
[00:02:12.680] - Speaker 1
Yes, I don't know it.
[00:02:14.630] - Speaker 2
And do you know of a case of a snake bite? A sister.
[00:02:18.140] - Speaker 1
A sister older than her went to clean a bush in the garden and was about to pick some leaves when she saw it there and bit it. Yes, she bit it there.
[00:02:29.930] - Speaker 2
And what happened? She went - They threw her out of the village, they sent her to El Carmen and there El Carmen didn't control her.
[00:02:36.620] - Speaker 1
But after that she was a bit weird, like that, and she spent some time sleepwalking and then she came back and got herself together.
[00:02:45.190] - Speaker 2
And is she all right now?
[00:02:47.890] - Speaker 1
Yes, it's fine, completely fine.
[00:02:51.170] - Speaker 2
And I have no more questions. Do you have anything else to say about the snake?
[00:02:55.750] - Speaker 1
No, I haven't. So she looked, no. Me, in cases like that, No, I haven't looked at anything.
[00:03:01.830] - Speaker 2
And also, if you are going to get bitten by a snake, it is important to know which snake it is.
[00:03:08.350] - Speaker 1
Of course, they say that.
[00:03:10.450] - Speaker 2
Can you kill her and take her to the hospital or can you take a photo?
[00:03:15.050] - Speaker 1
Of course, they say it's essential to know what, because if you arrive and don't know who bit you, they can't do anything, right? Yes. But I don't know anything about that. Well. I don't know anything, yes. Thank you very much. With pleasure, for you, very kind.
[00:03:31.450] - Speaker 2
Thank you very much. Thank you.
