[00:00:35.170] - Speaker 2
And do you have children?
[00:00:36.820] - Speaker 1
Yes, but they're all grown up now. They don't live with us anymore.
[00:00:40.120] - Speaker 2
And how many years have you lived in El Carmen?
[00:00:44.350] - Speaker 1
All my life, practically. Well, let him live, let him live with her here, we're more or less like 44 years old.
[00:00:55.430] - Speaker 2
So, do you think it's likely that you'll be bitten by a snake? No, yes, of course.
[00:01:00.010] - Speaker 1
Here, yes, of course. The probability does not fail. In fact, just last week I had my brother-in-law over there in the bushes working and he killed two of the poisonous ones that are believed to be poisonous, that one already knows here in the region that they are poisonous and they were already big.
[00:01:17.370] - Speaker 2
And do you know which snake?
[00:01:19.600] - Speaker 1
Here they call it talla X. That's a brave one.
[00:01:23.980] - Speaker 2
And have any of your animals been bitten by a snake?
[00:01:29.040] - Speaker 1
No, not one of mine. I have seen some animals, let's say, bitten horses or cows, but not much. Here in the region, we peasants know or say that when an animal dies, it has been bitten by a snake, because vultures don't eat it right away like any other animal. They say that a snake-bitten animal, until it bursts open by itself, is not eaten by the vulture.
[00:02:06.030] - Speaker 2
And do you know how to prevent or avoid a snakebite?
[00:02:12.460] - Speaker 1
No, I have no idea. The truth is, in that sense, I really have no idea. There is a lot of history that says that some say that you have to cut yourself in the shape of a cross and spill blood, others that But then you have heard that it is dangerous to absorb it because you can pass the poison on to the person.
[00:02:35.360] - Speaker 2
And before I bite, do you know how to prevent or avoid snakes? No, no idea.
[00:02:45.420] - Speaker 1
You too? No, you always go to the doctor straight away. If he's nearby, well
[00:02:49.670] - Speaker 2
Yes. And what would you do if you were bitten by a snake? No, serious.
[00:02:54.390] - Speaker 1
Needless to say.
[00:02:56.320] - Speaker 2
Are you going to the hospital?
[00:02:58.480] - Speaker 1
Yes, of course, you would play from the time you are able, yes, from the time you are able to play.
[00:03:04.670] - Speaker 2
And which hospital?
[00:03:06.690] - Speaker 1
Here, in the region, in this sector, about two people have died from snake bites. But then, recently, a lady here was bitten by one of those little snakes we're talking about, so tiny, and they didn't pay attention to it because it was so small. But it turns out that one of those little things has even more venom. And the lady died.
[00:03:39.740] - Speaker 2
And would you trust the hospital, the Carmen, to cure a brunette?
[00:03:44.040] - Speaker 1
It's not that you don't trust the hospital, because these village hospitals are not qualified to But if you notify them once, let's say, here, the most likely thing is that they will notify the Tolemaida brigade and there they supposedly keep the antidote.
[00:04:03.750] - Speaker 2
Okay, yes? Would you trust other hospitals like Tolemaida or others?
[00:04:11.350] - Speaker 1
No, because Tolemaida really makes you feel more secure, if you know what I mean? Yes.
[00:04:16.160] - Speaker 2
Because that's where the antidotes are kept by the NEC, which is more common to all the people who keep everything in the jungle. And where do you feel it's more likely that a snake will bite you? In the countryside or in the house?
[00:04:38.120] - Speaker 1
In the field.
[00:04:39.470] - Speaker 2
Why?
[00:04:40.830] - Speaker 1
Because there is the jungle, the mountains, all of nature. Although it doesn't have to be removed from the house either.
[00:04:46.520] - Speaker 2
Yes, that too. And can you identify poisonous snakes or non-venomous ones?
[00:04:54.990] - Speaker 1
No, in that case you would have to look at it to know.
[00:05:01.050] - Speaker 2
And do you know of any cases of snakebite? Yes, of course. And do all the cases happen In the countryside or where?
[00:05:17.050] - Speaker 1
No, yes, usually in the countryside.
[00:05:20.540] - Speaker 2
I have no more questions, but you have more to say about snakes or your knowledge of snakes.
[00:05:29.790] - Speaker 1
No, no, it's not ruled out that maybe, if not in the countryside, let's say, at a time like this, which is so rainy, they would tell stories of their grandparents, that And that we have to be careful because snakes kind of get tired of the humidity and look for the house to take refuge from the dryness.
[00:05:54.180] - Speaker 2
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
[00:05:56.930] - Speaker 1
No, just like that, out of the rest, just like that.
[00:05:59.450] - Speaker 2
Well, And it's important to know for snakebites, do you need to go straight to the hospital for the antidote after a snakebite.
[00:06:12.420] - Speaker 1
Yes, of course there is.
[00:06:13.390] - Speaker 2
There are many things that people say about how to avoid snake bites, but the most important is to go straight to the hospital.
[00:06:24.700] - Speaker 1
Yes, of course, the most important thing is.
[00:06:27.130] - Speaker 2
It is also important to know which snake Yes? Yes, of course. It bit you.
[00:06:33.230] - Speaker 1
Above all because snakes are usually aggressive.
[00:06:38.120] - Speaker 2
Yes.
[00:06:38.710] - Speaker 1
They, as I said, they attack you and they don't run away from where they attack you. They just lie there for a while. Because the ones that are fast, there's almost no danger. Let's say that the bravest ones here, as I was saying, the talla X, one that they called, that you hardly see around here anymore, they called her the pudidora. And what was the other one? No, those two were the ones that camouflage themselves in the dry vegetation and then they look very similar to the dry vegetation. And they never run away, when they sense you, they never run away. They always gather themselves, they stay still so they can attack.
[00:07:28.280] - Speaker 2
Well, thank you very much for your time. Well, I don't know. Thank you very much. That's it.
