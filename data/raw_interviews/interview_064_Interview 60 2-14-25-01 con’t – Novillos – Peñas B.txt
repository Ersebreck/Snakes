From there. And one day, one morning, there were four of us going, and this man was bitten by a snake, a really small one. A zapa, they call them, but it was a size X. A size X, and it almost killed him. And where did it bite him? He was going to some hills and it bit him here, here it bit him. And he said: Oh! It got me with a wire. Wire, we saw it, it was there, coiled up, but it was that small. It stung him. So he said: No, that's nothing, if it's that small, I told you it's nothing. According to the lady up there, the bull stung him once and killed him. And that small. Now this one is purebred, this one is good, we'll leave it there, they killed her and left her there. They rushed her to the hospital, they took him to the hospital and there they told him: Well, we need the snake that bit her so they sent the boy, one of the boys who went with us and he took her.
[00:01:02.462] - Speaker 2
And they studied her, they sent him there to Lebanon, Tolima. When he got there, they put the But he almost died. And that was in a moment when he got to the hospital, already the leg, already the... He had two poisons, the one from the shoe and the one from the X-ray.
[00:01:22.140] - Speaker 2
And in that tiny moment that he injected him with, he managed to break here and he broke here. And he injected six grams of poison, he managed to try. And just like that, but the man almost died.

[00:01:48.620] - Speaker 1
If he doesn't wear it, at least he'll bring a photo. But the more likely it is that he'll wear it, the better.
[00:01:55.540] - Speaker 2
If he was sent, he'll take it.
[00:01:57.110] - Speaker 1
Because for himself, all the snakes are not the same antidote. That's right, they are not the same antidote.
[00:02:01.920] - Speaker 2
Can't she see the cousin? The one that bit the There, they didn't know which snake, which... But they didn't know and they gave her the antidote and she was a... She lives in bed and she knows she lives because she's in bed. But they say it was that they gave her the wrong antidote, they didn't know what animal bit her, if it was a snake, or a spider, or I don't know what.
[00:02:20.980] - Speaker 1
They gave him another one and they got him.
[00:02:21.890] - Speaker 2
Another one, yes. They made the bed bigger.
[00:02:24.310] - Speaker 1
That's why it's important to bring the photo or the animal, to fight for it, to kill it and to bring it back. Or an easier photo. They look over there and know what antedito they have to place on you.
[00:02:38.490] - Speaker 2
It lasted almost a month in the bean. Yesterday I was I really fear those animals. Of all the animals, I know I fear that one the most. When I tell it when I come here: "Well, water yourself, fear all around you, because I won't just stand there like that, it scares me a lot, because in winter they seek to keep warm".
[00:03:02.080] - Speaker 1

[00:03:13.360] - Speaker 2
Yes, fear. How bad, yes.
