[00:00:06.920] - Speaker 2

[00:00:08.710] - Speaker 1
No, single.
[00:00:10.000] - Speaker 2
And how many years have you lived in El Carmen?
[00:00:12.290] - Speaker 1
Here all my life. Okay. Yes, like that.
[00:00:15.520] - Speaker 2
So do you think it's likely you'll get bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:20.610] - Speaker 1
That one should bite him? Sure, why not, there are snakes here. Yes. Yes, of course, it could happen because there are. Yes, there are many.
[00:00:30.660] - Speaker 2
And have any of your animals been bitten by a snake?
[00:00:35.380] - Speaker 1
Well, sometimes they turn up like dogs that have been killed by snakes. Yes, because there are dogs that turn up and they are, I believe, dead. Snakes have killed them. Yes. Yes, the dogs. The dogs.
[00:00:48.430] - Speaker 2
And do you know how to prevent a snakebite?
[00:00:52.400] - Speaker 1
Well, around here the only thing is that some people say that when you get bitten by a snake, you shouldn't panic so much so that the poison doesn't spread so quickly and you should quickly look for the health center.
[00:01:07.240] - Speaker 2
And do you know how to prevent a snakebite before a snakebite?
[00:01:14.390] - Speaker 1
Even if you see it, you avoid it. Yes, because you can see the animal there as long as you don't step on it or touch it. You turn around. You leave, because they also respect your habit. Yes. Like everything else.
[00:01:32.080] - Speaker 2
And what would you do if you were bitten by a snake?
[00:01:39.850] - Speaker 1
Well, find a way to The health center, the closest one there is.
[00:01:46.050] - Speaker 2
And do you have a motorbike or something?
[00:01:50.310] - Speaker 1
I would look for a means of transportation, whether it was an Express or whatever.
[00:01:54.530] - Speaker 2
Is it easy for you to go to the hospital? If you need to go to the hospital, is it easy or difficult?
[00:02:04.240] - Speaker 1
No, because suddenly the neighbor has a motorbike or you have a minute, you call them to come and pick you up. Everything they say, many times, sometimes that when you get bitten by a snake, what you want to avoid most is getting nervous, you want to stay calm. Yes, exactly. Yes, stay calm.
[00:02:24.920] - Speaker 2
And would you trust the hospital, the Carmen, to cure a bite?
[00:02:29.390] - Speaker 1
They say they have antivenom there. Because that's what they say saves you, antivenom from the same snake. From the same snake it's the opposite.
[00:02:42.920] - Speaker 2
And would you trust other hospitals too, near to El Carmen?
[00:02:47.040] - Speaker 1
Yes, because sometimes when they don't have the Carmen, they refer you to Tolemayra or they're going to admit you from Yes, wherever. But that's precisely where the hospital has, I think, I don't know, they said they had amphidontics there, I don't know now. Hello.
[00:03:02.390] - Speaker 2
Yeah? Okay, good. And where do you feel it is more likely that a snake will bite you? In the countryside or at home?
[00:03:11.950] - Speaker 1
Well, you know, they're animals, and sometimes that has happened even in houses. Yes, because in winter they can be seen. But even those two cases that have happened here have been in houses. Right now they supposedly say that the smaller a snake, the more poisonous it is. So they say that the small snake has a fuller gland, that sometimes a large snake is less dangerous, so the snake keeps the gland empty. Because sometimes they bite you and don't do anything, because sometimes they have an empty gland too. Well, that's lucky, isn't it?
[00:03:50.410] - Speaker 2
Exactly. And can you identify poisonous snakes or non-venomous ones? Yes, I know them. And how can snakes be identified?
[00:04:00.090] - Speaker 1
Yes, one doesn't know that, what it already talks about here, the most is the size and suddenly that coral. It is one of the most poisonous here. Not the rest, the others are already harmless snakes.
[00:04:13.940] - Speaker 2
And yes, you know of two cases of snakebite. And both happened at home, in their homes.
[00:04:23.470] - Speaker 1
Yes, in the houses themselves, those were the two cases that happened, because one was fatal and the other was It caused death, right?
[00:04:33.000] - Speaker 2
Yes. And they both went to the hospital? Yes. But one person died. Yes, one died. Why?
[00:04:45.190] - Speaker 1
Part of it was because of the delay, that they didn't leave the same night and they didn't leave the next day. Yes, okay. Because they don't want it immediately. In the case of looking for a means of transport, whatever, fast. It's the speed with which one is in the hospital.
[00:05:03.610] - Speaker 2
And they were both size X.
[00:05:10.280] - Speaker 1
They're size X. Yes, supposedly they're those kind of little snakes.
[00:05:14.460] - Speaker 2
Okay, well, I don't have any more questions. But you have more to say about snakes or your knowledge of them.
[00:05:22.420] - Speaker 1
No, because several are known, but they are not poisonous. There are many species.
[00:05:27.280] - Speaker 2
Yes, exactly.
[00:05:28.710] - Speaker 1
Here the poison is the size. And suddenly the coral, but the coral is not seen around here, almost, it is very rare, it is very scarce.
[00:05:38.140] - Speaker 2
Yes.
[00:05:38.250] - Speaker 1
And the rest?
[00:05:40.270] - Speaker 2
Yes, well. And it's important to know if And to take your snake lover, go straight to the hospital. Yes, of course. And it's important to know which snake bit you.
[00:05:54.790] - Speaker 1
Of course, because they say that supposedly, if one bites it, if it has the cell phone, it took the photo.
[00:05:58.680] - Speaker 2
Yes, exactly. Or the O to catch the animal, to take a piece, even if it's just so that they can put the amphibian on one of the same.
[00:06:06.590] - Speaker 1
Because how can they give you another amphibian, it has to be the same one. The same one, in the same way.
[00:06:17.270] - Speaker 2
Well, thank you very much, Liza.
[00:06:19.900] - Speaker 1
Well, miss. Yes, there was an induction here by other gentlemen who came to teach us that, because you would first see any snake from the del. Then the guys came and taught us that many snakes, let's not fuck them up now, because they are not They are harmless. Yes. Yes, because what happened was that you thought every snake was dangerous. And so they came here and... There was also training on that. And animals are respected.
[00:06:48.770] - Speaker 2
No, exactly. Exactly. They also have Good morning, yes.
[00:06:51.900] - Speaker 1
They fulfill a role on earth. These animals are respected.
[00:06:58.540] - Speaker 2
Yes, yes, exactly. Thank you very much for your time.
[00:07:03.470] - Speaker 1
