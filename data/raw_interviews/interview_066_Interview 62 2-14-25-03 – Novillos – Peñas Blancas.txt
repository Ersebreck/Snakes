I am usually self-employed.
[00:00:11.600] - Speaker 2

[00:00:15.320] - Speaker 1

[00:00:16.410] - Speaker 2
And how many years have you lived in El Carmen?
[00:00:19.190] - Speaker 1
Me, all my life, since I was born.
[00:00:22.860] - Speaker 2
And do you think it's likely that you'll be bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:27.400] - Speaker 1
Yes, of course.
[00:00:28.320] - Speaker 2
Why?
[00:00:29.330] - Speaker 1
Because we are in a rural area, normally and habitually you see many snakes of different kinds.
[00:00:38.420] - Speaker 2
Yes. And have any of your animals been bitten by a snake?
[00:00:43.910] - Speaker 1
Yes.
[00:00:44.840] - Speaker 2
What's the name? Cavao. A cavao?
[00:00:45.800] - Speaker 1
A horse.
[00:00:47.270] - Speaker 2
And did he bite?
[00:00:50.260] - Speaker 1
Yes, they really did give him anticoagulant medication, but it was already too late and he died.
[00:00:59.920] - Speaker 2
And do you know how to prevent or avoid a snakebite?
[00:01:04.200] - Speaker 1
Well, normally now, anything that might bite us or something like that, we have to run to the hospital, which sometimes calls Tolemaida, the base where they have the anti
[00:01:19.360] - Speaker 2
Yes. And before a snake bite, do you know how to prevent one? No. Okay. And what would you do if you were bitten by a snake?
[00:01:31.380] - Speaker 1
It would be really, well no, I think the first thing would be to go to a place where they have antidotes. Yes.
[00:01:46.460] - Speaker 2
And is it difficult or easy for you to go to the hospital?
[00:01:55.290] - Speaker 1
Well, sometimes it's complicated, but sometimes it's easy, yes. But sometimes the problem is that you always live far away, sometimes life doesn't cooperate much, it always gets damaged. Sometimes, as sometimes, it's easy because when they fix it and all that.
[00:02:11.640] - Speaker 2
And sometimes it's difficult because you don't have transportation or because the road is bad.
[00:02:19.400] - Speaker 1
Well, sometimes it's because the road is bad, but yes, probably yes, most people here have their own means of transport.
[00:02:29.490] - Speaker 2
And would you trust the hospital, in El Carmen, to cure a snakebite?
[00:02:35.050] - Speaker 1
Well, normally, what they do from there is what they do to one to refer it.
[00:02:39.050] - Speaker 2
And would you trust other hospitals to cure a snakebite?
[00:02:45.180] - Speaker 1
Well yes, I believe so, yes.
[00:02:48.430] - Speaker 2
And where do you feel it is more likely that a snake will bite you, in the countryside or at home?
[00:02:59.220] - Speaker 1
Probably not, probably in the house, so they almost try to take refuge. And sometimes she doesn't see it. Let's say, about eight days ago we killed one here, it was there in the hidden pot and my mom was watering the plant and she didn't even realize it, but when she saw it she poured water on it and it came out that way.
[00:03:18.920] - Speaker 2
Yes, okay. And can you identify poisonous snakes or non-poisonous snakes?
[00:03:26.720] - Speaker 1
Yes.
[00:03:27.390] - Speaker 2
How can snakes identify each other?
[00:03:29.380] - Speaker 1
The poisonous ones have geometric figures on their bodies and heads.
[00:03:36.820] - Speaker 2
And do you know of any cases of snakebite? And what happened?
[00:03:44.190] - Speaker 1
In one case, a person died because the problem was transportation, there was no one to transport them. And in another, the case was attended to quickly and the person was saved, thank God.
[00:04:00.300] - Speaker 2
And do the cases happen in the field or at home?
[00:04:06.270] - Speaker 1
Mostly in the house. They went in the house, yes.
[00:04:10.580] - Speaker 2
I have no more questions, but you have more to say about snakes or your knowledge of snakes.
[00:04:18.050] - Speaker 1
Well, not about snakes, not really. I've only seen two cases of people being bitten that I've seen, because I did listen too much. Other than that, no. I have seen snakes, an impressive number.
[00:04:36.490] - Speaker 2
Well, it's also important to know how to go straight to the hospital if you've been bitten by a snake. And it's important to know which snake bit you too.
[00:04:51.200] - Speaker 1
That's right, yes.
[00:04:52.020] - Speaker 2
Because there are different anti-physicists.
[00:04:55.090] - Speaker 1
Yes, there are times, in both cases here, that people were stung by the snakes who wanted to catch them and they put them in a bag and took them away to verify which snake had bitten them.
[00:05:06.470] - Speaker 2
Yes. Yes. Yes, yes. Thank you very much, Lizo. Okay.
