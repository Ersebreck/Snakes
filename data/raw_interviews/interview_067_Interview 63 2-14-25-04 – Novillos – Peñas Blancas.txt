[00:00:31.850] - Speaker 1
That is, 74 years.
[00:00:35.180] - Speaker 2
Okay, yes. And do you think it's likely that you'll be bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:44.060] - Speaker 1
At least one of them is going to be able to work, because one runs the risk of a snake biting you. And the more X-sized ones that are more poisonous, more vicious. Yes, you do throw yourself at that one, because you get bitten by that one and if you go near it, I told you: Now, ready to pounce, once they send that one to you, they send it to bite you.
[00:01:14.900] - Speaker 2
And have any of your animals been bitten by a snake?
[00:01:22.310] - Speaker 1
Yes, several people here have been bitten by snakes. A lady over there even got bitten by a snake and it killed her. And what's more, she didn't go to the doctor straight away, the same day she was bitten. Because when a snake bites you, you have to go immediately to get the Antivenom serum.
[00:01:46.810] - Speaker 3
Yes.
[00:01:48.110] - Speaker 2
And have any of your animals been bitten?
[00:01:52.930] - Speaker 1
How?
[00:01:53.850] - Speaker 2
An animal of yours, a pet of yours?
[00:01:57.120] - Speaker 1
Some animals, a pet that has bitten you?
[00:02:00.130] - Speaker 2
Yes.
[00:02:01.550] - Speaker 1
Yes, over here a neighbor who had a dog, I saw that it went down. Like that dog is scared of animals, I mean, a hunting dog there, those dogs run the risk of being bitten by a snake, a size.
[00:02:22.030] - Speaker 2
And do you know how to prevent or avoid a snakebite before it happens?
[00:02:32.480] - Speaker 1
In other words, to prevent a mess. So, yes, you know that But the most likely thing is to go to the doctor where they have the anti-venom, right? Yes, of course. Because that way, remedies that are homemade, who knows, right?
[00:02:51.700] - Speaker 3
Yes, yes.
[00:02:53.430] - Speaker 2
But before we go any further, do you have any methods for preventing bites?
[00:02:59.130] - Speaker 1
methods?
[00:02:59.970] - Speaker 3
Uh-huh.
[00:03:01.430] - Speaker 1
Well, they say you should get laid. They say you should get laid and that you should also take one against it, like they say the bubble guide, which is that it's good for that. Well, the moment you have it, you can take it, but whenever that is. And if you don't have it, the quickest thing is to go to the doctor.
[00:03:40.130] - Speaker 2
And what would you do if you were bitten by a snake?
[00:03:46.360] - Speaker 1
Well, the most logical thing is to go to the doctor. Or get laid, because the poison isn't laughing there.
[00:03:56.840] - Speaker 2
And which doctor would you go to if you were bitten? To the hospital, because where In El Carmen?
[00:04:03.320] - Speaker 1
In El Carmen, yes. Because as a first In El Carmen, aren't you just closer? Yes. And there, if they have the serum, the tax office or something they have to do to him, because then, while if not, then they will transfer him to another place, to another place where in the serum, to the opposite.
[00:04:33.520] - Speaker 2
Would you trust the hospital, the Carmen, to cure a snakebite?
[00:04:39.230] - Speaker 1
Well, the first thing you have to take care of is the nearest hospital.
[00:04:44.220] - Speaker 2
And would you trust other hospitals to treat a snakebite?
[00:04:52.400] - Speaker 1
Yes, wherever they send it, let's say. Because at least in El Carmen, if they don't have, let's say, the serum, they will send it to another hospital where there is a supply, that is, the serum. At least in one hospital, in El Carmen they have to have the serum there so that they have it there for when someone has been bitten by a snake. Because then
[00:05:28.760] - Speaker 3
Yes.
[00:05:30.750] - Speaker 2
And where do you feel it is more likely that you will be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:05:39.190] - Speaker 1
Well, at home, at night, at least they already get up at night, they come to the houses, let's say, over there to catch mice or to catch a bug, over there they already ate. Or at night, as they search, it's like looking for the house. I mean, when it rains, one also draws near there So that's why you have to have, let's say, come night when you get up, you have to have your torch to hand. And in the fields, in the bushes, over there in the plot, in the crops it's also likely that one will bite you. Because there aren't many of them over there, in the north.
[00:06:35.310] - Speaker 3
Yes.
[00:06:37.210] - Speaker 2
And can you identify poisonous snakes or non-poisonous ones?
[00:06:43.980] - Speaker 1
At least size X is known, it's true that there's a drought here. And the others, there are some As there are some that don't... The ones they call güi or vomitar, we call them, that one is not It's not harmful, they say today. They say it's not harmful, but they can mold it, they can bite it. Do you know what they'll do to it? That after one bites it, it has to have something on its horns, because they have The snake has to have horns.
[00:07:22.490] - Speaker 2
And do you know of any cases of death from snake bites? How do people get bitten by snakes?
[00:07:36.680] - Speaker 1
Yes. At least over there, over here, around the corner, there have also been loads of cases, over there they've been like they're going to die from snakes.
[00:07:48.200] - Speaker 2
And do the cases happen in the countryside or in houses?
[00:07:54.470] - Speaker 1
In the countryside, over there, they go out to work, to see the animals, in the countryside over there. They also fish, not that they go at night, it's dangerous.
[00:08:06.370] - Speaker 3
Yes, of course.
[00:08:08.890] - Speaker 1
And more at night, they're going to be able to fish, not that always in the morning, somewhere near the water.
[00:08:15.610] - Speaker 3
Yes, it is dangerous.
[00:08:17.530] - Speaker 1
Or they walk along a path at night, along the roads. There may be a danger that it will be a bite in the balls.
[00:08:29.950] - Speaker 2
Well, I don't have any more questions, but you have more to say about snakes or your knowledge about snakes.
[00:08:41.090] - Speaker 1
That I have other knowledge?
[00:08:43.230] - Speaker 2
Yes. No, because that's it. It's okay if you don't have one. No, it's okay. And it's important to know if you were bitten by a snake and your right to hospital treatment. And it's also important to know which snake bit you.
[00:09:05.760] - Speaker 1
Find out what kind of snake it is. Yes. Because at least one of them has to be taken and it was bitten by a snake. The doctor has to know what kind of snake it is so he can look for the serum.
[00:09:18.210] - Speaker 2
Exactly.
[00:09:19.100] - Speaker 1
Because not just any serum will do. Because you might get bitten by a spider and say it's a snake, they'll give you a snake serum that's an X size. So what they do is they kind of perrubricate it. That's what happened to a lady over there, the media, she lived there, I don't know. She was bitten by something, I don't know if it was a spider, but she said it was a snake, but they didn't check, let's say, to see if it was a snake. And they gave her the serum that was for snakes. And that's why the doctors there like it, but they want you to bring the animal that bit you. If it's a laceration, yes. Because the bite is a laceration, it's different from a spider bite. Because the spider has a fang and they give you two fangs buried in the sign. The same with the snake. Because the snake also has the cormillo and it is different, because the bite on the skull is different.
[00:10:45.768] - Speaker 1
The sting, not just a single sting. Because they have more cormillo and more that is like a call, a stinger or whatever it is.
[00:11:00.670] - Speaker 3
Yes.
[00:11:01.340] - Speaker 1
In the loneliest.
[00:11:02.980] - Speaker 3
Yes, of course.
[00:11:04.510] - Speaker 1
And also a boy over there, at Cuatro Esquina too, who was also given an IV, because we saw a snake and it wasn't a snake. He put his feet in a bottle this long, like this. And as he said, it was already a scorpion.
[00:11:28.100] - Speaker 3
Yes.
[00:11:29.900] - Speaker 1
And then I was going to sit down the puncture, which was different from the puncture of a scorpion, of a snake. At least, that one was like that at home, that the other day it was at home, because he was going to work, so I'm going to give him a beating, so they worked out. Then they realized it was a snake. So they took him to the hospital and gave him antivenom, snake antivenom. They did that because the
[00:12:12.550] - Speaker 3
Exactly, yes.
[00:12:14.110] - Speaker 1
That's why you have to know what animal is biting you.
[00:12:20.080] - Speaker 3
It is important, yes.
[00:12:22.600] - Speaker 1
Because the scorpion is different.
[00:12:24.610] - Speaker 3
It's different, yes. Although it's a letdown.
[00:12:29.460] - Speaker 1
Because I think the snake leaves both horns, the two marks there. And I make one for the scorpion and it goes to sleep and you catch it like that.
[00:12:40.150] - Speaker 3
But then it isn't. Because at least
[00:12:47.430] - Speaker 1
However, they always have to carry the scorpion so the doctor can see what serum they are putting on it.
[00:13:00.600] - Speaker 3
Yes.
[00:13:01.090] - Speaker 1
To cut the poison.
[00:13:05.190] - Speaker 3
Yes. Yes.
[00:13:09.170] - Speaker 2
Yes. Yes.
