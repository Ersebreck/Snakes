And do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:40.820] - Speaker 1
Yes, of course, because there are a lot of them here Let's say it's a very good environment for snakes, because there are a lot of trees, as you can see, there are a lot of mountains, there are a lot of leaves there. If you know what I mean, all that means that snakes are abundant there. Yes. We have found a lot of snakes there and my husband has killed them. This is an environment that's just right for them and when you go out there, it's like the town, you come across them, huge snakes.

Which doctor?
[00:01:39.410] - Speaker 1
Over in Carmen de Apicala, we have our health insurance companies there, so they provide us with the service there.
[00:01:47.680] - Speaker 2
Would you trust the hospital in El Carmen to cure a snakebite?
[00:01:53.820] - Speaker 1
Yes, I suppose so.
[00:01:56.100] - Speaker 2

[00:02:01.170] - Speaker 1
Yes, of course.
[00:02:03.040] - Speaker 2

[00:02:06.490] - Speaker 1
Well, in Girardot, in Espinal, which are the closest.
[00:02:13.930] - Speaker 2
And where do you feel it is most likely that you will be bitten by a snake?
[00:02:19.500] - Speaker 1
When one goes, let's say, there to the mountains.
[00:02:23.340] - Speaker 2
In the field, not in the house.
[00:02:26.320] - Speaker 1
Not so much, but you still have to be careful at night because they can get in.
[00:02:33.360] - Speaker 2
And can you identify poisonous snakes from non-poisonous ones? No. I don't know. It's difficult.
[00:02:41.700] - Speaker 1
Yes.
[00:02:42.510] - Speaker 2
And do you know of any cases of snake deaths?
[00:02:46.650] - Speaker 1
No. No? I've heard about it, but I haven't seen it.
[00:02:50.640] - Speaker 2
You don't know. Okay. Well, what if you need to go to the hospital, is it difficult for you or is it easy?
[00:03:00.050] - Speaker 1
It's always difficult because it takes us half an hour to get from here to there by motorbike. And on foot it's two hours. So there are many possibilities and dangers. Yes, everything. And the road is bad.
[00:03:14.300] - Speaker 2
Totally, totally. Okay. And I have no more questions, but you have more to say about snakes or your knowledge of them.
[00:03:27.510] - Speaker 1
Well, I don't know if people know about snakes.
[00:03:29.800] - Speaker 2
Do you know how to tell if a snake is poisonous or not? Yes. Whether you have more to say or not.
[00:03:44.710] - Speaker 1
No.
[00:03:45.190] - Speaker 2
Right? Okay. Yes.
[00:03:47.280] - Speaker 1
So, let's say that's my concern. Okay. Yes. So, I don't know. That's what I have. Let's say I really don't know about that, I really don't know.
[00:03:58.780] - Speaker 2
Yes, okay. And the most important information is if you get a snake bite, go straight to the hospital. And it's also important to know which snake bit you, because there are different anti-poisons for different snakes. It's important to take a photo of the snake or kill it and take it to the hospital. And yes. That's it. Thank you very much.
