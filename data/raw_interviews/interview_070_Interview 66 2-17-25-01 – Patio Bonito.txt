All my life.
[00:00:28.030] - Speaker 1
So, do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:34.450] - Speaker 2
Yes, it's likely. Why? Because there are a lot of sluts in this area.
[00:00:40.860] - Speaker 1
And have any of your animals been bitten by a snake? One of your pets? No, not a pet. Do you have any other animals, like cows?
[00:00:56.450] - Speaker 2
No, not here in this condominium, but I have heard it elsewhere.
[00:01:03.370] - Speaker 1
And do you know how to prevent or avoid snake bites? No. What would you do if a snake bit you?
[00:01:16.290] - Speaker 2
Well, you turn to the myths that people say you can do Cutting yourself isn't the solution, because you always think it is and it isn't the solution to that. There are others who say that... What? That they urinate and drink a little bit. Some say that, but I've never done it because I never want it to happen, God forbid. But they say they drink a little bit of urine while they're going to the doctor.
[00:01:41.150] - Speaker 1
Which doctor?
[00:01:44.730] - Speaker 2
It's your turn to pay for the clinic once and for all.
[00:01:48.130] - Speaker 1
In the lipstick or in the trash?
[00:01:51.470] - Speaker 2
The pull is most likely, the spin.
[00:01:54.140] - Speaker 1
Why?
[00:01:57.010] - Speaker 2
Because a long time ago, my mom was bitten by a snake, like in the forest. Maybe she got tired of it, I don't remember exactly. She was bitten by a snake, and we brought her to the village, and they threw us out to get her out of there. Then we went straight to clean everything up.
[00:02:16.090] - Speaker 1
So, would you trust the hospital, in Carmen, to treat a snake bite?
[00:02:22.940] - Speaker 2
Not really.
[00:02:24.470] - Speaker 1
Why?
[00:02:26.700] - Speaker 2
Because we still don't have the necessary supplies, such as saline solution, which is the most important thing. We don't have it.
[00:02:36.520] - Speaker 1
But would you trust other hospitals to treat a bite wound? Yes, of course. Which hospitals?
[00:02:41.950] - Speaker 2
It would be in Girardón, at the Lumen clinic, which is the one they always refer us to from here.
[00:02:50.460] - Speaker 1
And where do you feel most likely to be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:02:57.950] - Speaker 2
In the countryside.
[00:02:59.000] - Speaker 1
Why?
[00:03:00.350] - Speaker 2
Because that's where we've seen them, almost always. They've come here to our house, but not for a long time. But over there, in the vacant lots, yes.
[00:03:10.790] - Speaker 1
And can you identify six poisonous snakes or snakes that are nine-tailed? Yes. And how will you identify them?
[00:03:18.950] - Speaker 2
I always think that when we see a snake and it stays there, it's because it's poisonous. If it runs away, it's not poisonous. That's what we always believe.
[00:03:29.770] - Speaker 1
Which ones? Which ones are poisonous? They are poisonous, yes.
[00:03:36.100] - Speaker 2
So, what snakes or what?
[00:03:37.360] - Speaker 1
Yes, like And the characteristics, do you know about poisonous bites? What are the characteristics?
[00:03:52.030] - Speaker 2
The name of the poisonous snake, or do you describe its characteristics, such as whether it is large or small?
[00:03:57.490] - Speaker 1
Yes, what they look like. I'm sorry, I don't know how to say it, but The skin or the eyes or the body, how can you identify poisonous snakes?
[00:04:16.140] - Speaker 2
No, because you know them, but you don't know if they're smooth or poisonous, so you're afraid. Because there are smooth ones that are also poisonous, and there are different types of vascularity.
[00:04:29.320] - Speaker 1
And do you know of any cases of snake bites?
[00:04:35.630] - Speaker 2
From the same mother who left her mark on us, because my mother was really sick from that bitch.
[00:04:42.380] - Speaker 1
Your mom?
[00:04:43.310] - Speaker 2
Yes.
[00:04:44.160] - Speaker 1
And a poisonous one? She was bitten by a poisonous one. And what happened?
[00:04:50.650] - Speaker 2
We called it a clinic, but she was in intensive care for 13 days. Her kidneys were paralyzed from that bite. She almost needed dialysis, but thank God she didn't have to continue with it. It was very scary.
[00:05:10.560] - Speaker 1
Yes, that's too bad. And did the bite heal, or did I go to the countryside? To the countryside, yes. And did she receive any anti-physiological drugs, antidotes? Yes, ma'am. And well, no. And also, if you need to go to the hospital or doctor, is that difficult for you or easy?
[00:05:37.870] - Speaker 2
No, it's easy. Yes, it's easy. Yes, it's easy. I mean, it's easy, you can take a car, or a motorcycle, whatever, and you can get to the hospital quickly.
[00:05:45.450] - Speaker 1
Okay. Yes, I don't have any more questions, but do you have anything else to say about snakes or your knowledge? No, not about snakes. And yes, the most important information is that if you get a snake bite, it's important to go straight to the hospital and it's also important to know what kind of snake bit you. Sure. Yes.
[00:06:12.970] - Speaker 2
That's very important, because that's what happened with my mom. My mom didn't know exactly, she just told us, "It's this color," and then she left us. So we had to guess.
[00:06:23.940] - Speaker 1
And how did the doctors find it? We brought one, but we found it there, but it wasn't it.
[00:06:34.950] - Speaker 2
We cleaned up the field to see what we could find where she was bitten. And it wasn't that one. It wasn't that one, because the one we took wasn't.
[00:06:46.040] - Speaker 1
And at the hospital, she went to the hospital and didn't know.
[00:06:54.050] - Speaker 2
We didn't know that a culera had bitten her. She would say, "It's this color," but when we asked her, "This color?" she would say, "Yes," and then finally she would say That's another characteristic thing, so we didn't know exactly which one we had gone for.
[00:07:07.300] - Speaker 1
But they give it to him They X, I'm sorry. The anti-physical, which snake?
[00:07:20.810] - Speaker 2
For size X.
[00:07:22.590] - Speaker 1
Okay. Because they did a test on your blood to find out which snake bit you?
[00:07:36.790] - Speaker 2
Well, the truth is that because my mom was hospitalized for so long, we didn't find out until the end whether they had always done it or not. They did a lot of tests on her, but they left because of the high cost here. They put her on an IV, and I had to say that was what it was.
[00:07:53.050] - Speaker 1
Okay, ready. Yes, good. Yes, ready. Thank you. That's all I have.
