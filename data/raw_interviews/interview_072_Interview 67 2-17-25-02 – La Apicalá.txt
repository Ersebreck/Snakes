Okay. And do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here? Why?
[00:00:39.180] - Speaker 1
Based on the studies that have been analyzed, it's always as I would say? It's deadly, the venom of those snakes is deadly. Not all of them, because there is one, the patra. But it's always deadly, I've always heard, because I've never been bitten, but I have heard of people who have been bitten by snakes and some are not here to tell the tale.
[00:01:13.550] - Speaker 2
And why do you think it's unlikely that it would bite you here? Because it's careful. Okay. That's why. And have any of your animals ever been bitten by a snake? No. And do you know how to prevent or avoid a snake bite?

[00:02:03.460] - Speaker 2
And would you trust the hospital in Girardot to treat a snake bite?
[00:02:09.510] - Speaker 1
I think so.
[00:02:13.590] - Speaker 2
And would you trust other hospitals as well?
[00:02:16.700] - Speaker 1
Yes, they have the antidote, although there is only one, because not everyone has the antidote, but there are some who do have the antidote for the poison.
[00:02:26.240] - Speaker 2
And where do you feel you are most likely to be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:02:33.350] - Speaker 1
In the countryside. You could say that you've always seen them around here, but no But you always see them off to the side. In the countryside, you see snakes, those snakes.
[00:02:46.920] - Speaker 2
And do you know how to identify poisonous and non-poisonous snakes?
[00:02:51.190] - Speaker 1
More or less, yes, very much so.
[00:02:53.900] - Speaker 2
And how can snakes be identified?
[00:02:58.450] - Speaker 1
Mostly, they're identified by their heads. I identify them by their heads. Okay, yes. That's all. When it goes triangular, if it's triangular, it goes in.
[00:03:06.740] - Speaker 2
Okay, yes.
[00:03:07.720] - Speaker 1
And don't give it to the other one.
[00:03:09.900] - Speaker 2
And do you know of any cases of snake bites? No. And if you need to go to the hospital, is that difficult or easy for you?
[00:03:23.810] - Speaker 1
Well, at the moment it's difficult, because if you have a bite like that, you have to get to the hospital as quickly as possible, because the poison spreads quickly, so everyone has to get to the hospital as quickly as possible. I'd like to go in a car or on a motorbike, but really, you have to go as fast as you can to get there. Otherwise, if you don't make it, you'll go to heaven.
[00:03:54.350] - Speaker 2
Well, I don't have any more questions. Do you have anything else to say about snakes or your knowledge? No, no. No? Okay. Well, thank you very much. You're welcome.
