[00:02:17.110] - Speaker 2
Yes, I mean, I know a man who had an incident. Of course, the snake didn't actually bite him, but he had a wound, and when he killed the snake with a machete, it flew out of the snake.

And how can snakes be identified?
[00:03:26.910] - Speaker 2
Because of the color. They have certain characteristics: the coral one is red and black, the false coral one has a white stripe on its head, the size X one has an X, and the rattlesnake one rattles. And also the care they require, they don't kill. The hunter.
