From over there, Joaquín's sons, Gómez, the tough guys they call him. And I saw him over there, he was about to pass by and he said to me: Go over it, and I said: What? Go over it, that's all, I said: No, no, no. Because if I go over it on my motorcycle, the snake could get tangled up and bite me. And I said, 'If you hadn't told me, I would have gone around it. Imagine that. And another day, I was riding in the early morning with that storm, and I saw something like a stick there, and I said, 'That must be a stick that the storm blew down. And I passed by, and when I was over it, there was nothing left. I realized it was a snake. At home, you leave them alone, you leave them alone. It was this thick, but it was a snake, they call it a cuantas. And when I passed by with the moonlight from the motorcycle, I saw that the snake was writhing around all the cans.
