[00:00:01.000] - Speaker 2
In a little crack like that, you can easily get a knife in there and no one would see it. If the two are a little And there I killed corals, I killed... Rattles. Rattles. I killed a rattle, I killed... The cars that drive by. The coral.
[00:00:19.720] - Speaker 1
The red and black.
[00:00:21.050] - Speaker 2
I've killed several snakes here nearby. Were you walking in one of those ditches over there? Yes.
[00:00:28.380] - Speaker 3
Well, what's your name?

[00:00:33.250] - Speaker 3
And do you agree to the recording and interview?
[00:00:36.940] - Speaker 1
Sure.
[00:00:37.870] - Speaker 3
And what's your name? Camilo. And how old are you?
[00:00:46.560] - Speaker 1
I just turned 72 years old.
[00:00:50.740] - Speaker 3
You too?
[00:00:51.570] - Speaker 2
I am 37.
[00:00:53.450] - Speaker 3
And what do you do for a living?
[00:00:57.520] - Speaker 1
I am currently independent.
[00:00:59.900] - Speaker 3
You too? Are they married or single?
[00:01:07.900] - Speaker 1
I live alone.
[00:01:09.550] - Speaker 3
And you too? Me too. And how many years have you lived here in El Carmen? All my life. All your life. So, do you think it's likely that a snake could move you here?
[00:01:25.180] - Speaker 2
To be honest, the problem here isn't that someone bites it, but that the ones that show themselves get killed, because they don't let themselves be seen If a snake appears, you have to kill it.
[00:01:37.730] - Speaker 3
You don't have time for anything. And have any of your animals ever been bitten by a snake?
[00:01:50.710] - Speaker 2
No, not here, on this side. A while ago, on the other side of a small farm, a cow, he bit a little cow. But I don't know what happened to him. Did he kill her? Yes, he burned her, yes. I mean, they didn't realize it in time because the animals in the woods, in the pastures. The animals are left in the woods, in the pastures. When they found her, she was practically dead.
[00:02:26.240] - Speaker 3
And do you know how to prevent or avoid a bite from a snake?
[00:02:34.070] - Speaker 1
First aid, we're doing okay, because he's not scared. First, take him to the hospital, if you can get there. And make a tourniquet here so that it doesn't go up to where he's been bitten, and mold it here with a rubber band or a cord, whatever you have. Meanwhile, if you can get to the hospital or wherever they can treat him.
[00:03:03.650] - Speaker 2
Because the only other home remedy is borujo bile, which is very effective against snake bites.
[00:03:14.440] - Speaker 3
And before a snake bite, do you know how to avoid bites and snakes? Before a bite.
[00:03:23.590] - Speaker 1
Yes?
[00:03:25.080] - Speaker 3
Before a snake bite, do you know how to avoid snakes? Before or after the bite? Before.
[00:03:32.730] - Speaker 2
Before it bites you? Yes. I mean, if you see it and can't kill it right away, you scare it away and it goes away. Usually, you always, your whole life here, you keep an eye on where you're walking and everything.
[00:03:48.680] - Speaker 1
That's why we have to spray or burn it around here. Yes, that too. We have to burn it around here, spray it, use strong poison. Yes. So I can go in a little bit.
[00:04:06.240] - Speaker 3
And what would you do if a snake bit you?
[00:04:12.300] - Speaker 2
That's right, as the man says, you have to get to the hospital, make a tourniquet, and get to the hospital, unless you have a gorujo tooth. Because if you have a gorujo tooth, you take a spoonful and it expels the poison. The body rejects the poison.
[00:04:29.810] - Speaker 3
And do you agree with that?
[00:04:34.520] - Speaker 1
Because they say that when you cut yourself in a cross shape where the bite marks are, you have to suck, suck, suck with your mouth. But if your teeth aren't working, then you dance, you can't do that. Your teeth have to be clean.
[00:04:57.820] - Speaker 2
bat?
[00:04:58.230] - Speaker 1
I understand.
[00:05:01.380] - Speaker 2
I already bought the milk.
[00:05:03.360] - Speaker 3
And would you trust the hospital, in Carmen, to treat a snake bite? No. Okay, why not?
[00:05:11.240] - Speaker 2
Because it's useless. It doesn't even help with healing. Since we're poor, we only get one or two The truth is, the Carmen hospital is only good for giving injections and acetaminophen, which doesn't help with anything else. Yes, nothing else...
[00:05:31.630] - Speaker 1
Yes, hospitals are occupied.
[00:05:33.380] - Speaker 2
A serious injury, a motorcycle accident, they had to turn you twice, and I screamed, "Spinal cord!" because they don't do anything for you there.
[00:05:39.540] - Speaker 3
In case of an emergency, you have to go there, because that's where the battalion is, the tenth brigade, and get going.
[00:05:52.210] - Speaker 1
They have all the antidotes and everything there. Let's see if he can be saved.
[00:05:59.700] - Speaker 2
If they manage to get here. Okay, yes.
[00:06:04.420] - Speaker 1
That's the closest one there is, the best one.
[00:06:10.340] - Speaker 3
And where do you feel you are most likely to be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:06:18.640] - Speaker 2
Well, the truth is, as everyone in the sector knows, it's temporary. Suddenly, one can turn up here, another one can turn up there, because there are so many in this region. Haven't you had any in your house? There are loads. Yes, the neighbor, the neighbor killed one there in the little garden. They move a man in and kill him?
[00:06:40.980] - Speaker 1
Yes. And she lives there? Yes. And she lives right there.
[00:06:43.620] - Speaker 2
And here we've killed her too, they've put her in here.
[00:06:49.090] - Speaker 3
Which snake?
[00:06:50.900] - Speaker 2
More than anything else, Sabanera appeared here, the pudrigora, which is the most dangerous of all. Well, in this region, there is the pudrigora and the cascadel, but the cascadel is not seen continuously, but the most dangerous is the pudrigora, which bites and And the size X, which appears here. And the size, too. It appears a lot here.
[00:07:15.090] - Speaker 3
Yes, I do. And do you know how to identify poisonous snakes or snakes that are venomous?
[00:07:21.430] - Speaker 2
Yes, of course, yes. When I look at her, I recognize her right away.
[00:07:24.890] - Speaker 3
And how can snakes be identified?
[00:07:27.410] - Speaker 2
Because, honestly, snakes are all the same, and that's a lie, because one comes in one color, another comes in another, one is very similar, but they are all different. And once you've identified them, you know them by their color, you know which ones are poisonous and which ones aren't. So, you have them in your mind, you are aware of them.
[00:07:54.370] - Speaker 3
Sure. And do you know of any cases of snake bites?
[00:08:00.920] - Speaker 2
Around here, in this region, as far as I can remember. Not around here. No, not that I can remember. Well, only animals, San Mordido, yes, animals.
[00:08:09.970] - Speaker 1
Thank God, no. Yes, thank God. Animals, right?
[00:08:12.170] - Speaker 3
Sister of Mercedes, who lives in Corte Rua, over in Morteño.
[00:08:17.680] - Speaker 2
Yes, but that was in another neighborhood.
[00:08:19.740] - Speaker 1
On another sidewalk. Over there, Carmen, up ahead?
[00:08:23.400] - Speaker 2
Put some pants on your friend.
[00:08:24.930] - Speaker 1
Let's go grab a couple. Why do you call him that? Over there, Carmen, up there, and who's calling Morteño?
[00:08:28.860] - Speaker 2
Morteño, four corners.
[00:08:30.430] - Speaker 1
Vereda Morteño. Supposedly, a woman got up, I don't know, to go to the bathroom or something like that. To the bathroom? She was going to the bathroom, well. And she said to me: "I stepped on it, and boom, my love." And what I'm saying is, those things that Since she was so big, she was already a size X. And they left her like that, they didn't give her first aid or anything, and when the man got sick, they took him to the hospital and he died, because they didn't take her immediately after she was stabbed, they didn't realize anything. But the injuries, until the other day, they took her and she died. That's all, just a little thing like that.
[00:09:19.370] - Speaker 2
The smaller they are, the more lethal they are. Their venom is purer because they have never been stung.
[00:09:26.320] - Speaker 1
Her husband and sister said the same thing. That they weren't worried about me, that she was just like that, that she wasn't dangerous anymore. And that she was like that. That's what I've heard, and that's what you hear around here. Around here, it doesn't seem like that. I haven't had any problems.
[00:09:57.580] - Speaker 2
No, not around here. Yes, I've seen them, the size, but mostly, let's say, over there in the mountains, over that way, yes But you don't see many around here, mostly you see hunters and cowboys, and those little animals are defenseless. Well, not so defenseless, because they grab you and squeeze you and hurt you. But in the sense that they're poisonous or something, no. They're not poisonous. I mean, they're not dangerous animals.
[00:10:29.950] - Speaker 1
Yes, ma'am.
[00:10:34.800] - Speaker 3
Well, I don't have any more questions, but you have more to say about snakes or your knowledge.
[00:10:42.190] - Speaker 2
Well, you talk about the basics, what you are and what you've experienced. Why would you suddenly start lying to someone or making things up that you don't know? No, what you've been told is the truth. Of course, that's how you perceive it. Yes.
[00:11:01.000] - Speaker 3
Yes, the most important information. If you get a snake bite, it is important to go straight to the hospital.
[00:11:12.150] - Speaker 2
Obviously, yes, of course.
[00:11:13.780] - Speaker 3
And it's also important to know what kind of snake bit you, because there are different kinds. Keep that in mind, yes. Yes, there are different antivenoms. And tourniquets are not recommended, because you could end up losing an arm or a leg, because the poison needs to circulate in the body.
[00:11:43.740] - Speaker 1
So it's not recommended?
[00:11:48.660] - Speaker 3
Yes, it's not recommended. So what? Yes, it's not recommended. It is recommended. But yes, the most important information is to go straight to the hospital after a breakup and a reception. Yes, of course. And yes, thank you very much. That's all I have, but thank you very much. Yes, okay.
