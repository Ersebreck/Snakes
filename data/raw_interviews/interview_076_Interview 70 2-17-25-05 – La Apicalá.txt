And what would you do if a snake bit you?
[00:01:28.250] - Speaker 1
To be honest, I don't know, because it's never bitten me, but it must be terrible for an animal like that to be bitten by it. It must think it's going to die.
[00:01:37.610] - Speaker 2
Yes.
[00:01:38.060] - Speaker 1
Yes, because what salvation? Well, they say there is one I don't know, that you have to go to the hospital, but by the time you get there, it's dangerous. Maybe it's the ones who send her to pray, but I don't think so. I don't know, I don't really believe in that.
[00:01:55.980] - Speaker 2
And would you trust the nearest hospital here to cure a blackberry and snake bite?
[00:02:03.270] - Speaker 1
Well, I don't really know, because I rarely go to the hospital. Yes, for example, for essential things, such as tests, I do go there. But I don't know what level of hospital you need to go to for that, because it varies from one hospital to another. I don't know what level this hospital here is.
[00:02:28.000] - Speaker 2
So, which hospital would you go to if you got bitten there?
[00:02:32.140] - Speaker 1
So, from Urgencias to Girardot. Okay.
[00:02:35.340] - Speaker 2
And you would trust the hospital in Girardot to treat a snake bite? Where do you feel you are more likely to be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:02:58.090] - Speaker 1
I don't know. Outside? Outside the house.
[00:03:01.070] - Speaker 2
Just outside, only.
[00:03:01.870] - Speaker 1
Yes, ma'am, because you keep spraying poison, you keep spraying chlorine. Insects are very attracted to chlorine, lopecia, chlorine, faro soap, and you keep washing it, you keep it there. Those kiquitas say that kiquitas don't leave They are small animals, small chickens.
[00:03:25.070] - Speaker 2
Yes.

[00:03:36.610] - Speaker 1
I've been in the country all my life, but there are many kinds of snakes.
[00:03:41.200] - Speaker 2
No, it's difficult.
[00:03:42.830] - Speaker 1

And have you ever heard of a snake bite? No, ma'am.
[00:03:50.550] - Speaker 1
And I wouldn't want to, because I look at a bug and it scares me a lot. It's a lot, very favorable.
[00:03:57.940] - Speaker 2
Sure. And if you need to go to the hospital, is that difficult for you or easy?

And, well, I don't have any more questions, but I forgot to ask if you agree to the interview and the recording, right? Yes. Okay. Sorry, I forgot to ask. And, okay, well, I don't have any more questions. Do you have anything else to say about snakes or your knowledge? No. And yes, the most important information is that after a snake bite, go straight to the hospital. And it's important to know what kind of snake bit you, and if you can, take a picture of the snake or bring the snake to the hospital. Yes. Well, thank you very much. And that's it.
