Here I have heard of several cases where people have been killed by snakes.
[00:00:42.580] - Speaker 2
And has any of your animals ever been bitten by a snake? No, around here, for Aylin. And do you know how to prevent or avoid snake bites?
[00:00:54.690] - Speaker 3
Run and throw it in.
[00:00:58.030] - Speaker 2
Yes.
[00:00:59.860] - Speaker 3
No more.
[00:01:01.800] - Speaker 2
And before a snake bite, do you know how to prevent them?
[00:01:05.720] - Speaker 3
No, I know that if I were bitten by a snake, you have to go to the nearest medical center or go to everything else, the Mexicans, who have the wounded, the old ones.
[00:01:12.720] - Speaker 2
Yes, of course. But before a bite, how do you prevent bites?
[00:01:21.690] - Speaker 3
To prevent the pest from arriving here, we need to have chickens so that the child has space, we need to keep everything clean, trash cans, everything that can help us. I don't think so. Well, and use cryoline. Strong smells, mostly strong smells to make it go away.
[00:01:38.190] - Speaker 2
And what would you do if a snake bit you?
[00:01:43.480] - Speaker 3
I don't even want to think about it.
[00:01:46.870] - Speaker 2
Sure, sure, sure. And would you trust the nearest hospital here to treat a snake bite?
[00:01:55.730] - Speaker 3
The thing is, here we are so So, I saw a woman who had been bitten by a snake, and they took her to the hospital and left her to die because there are no resources. They have no resources. First, because when you're scared, you don't even look at what kind of snake bit you. And they have a photo of the snake that bit her, but I don't know what else, because they don't have the means. They don't have the scientific equipment to see what kind of venom it was, I don't know what's running through her veins. So, it's more certain than death than the antivenom.
[00:02:27.590] - Speaker 2
Yes. And was the Carmen Hospital where she was treated?
[00:02:32.010] - Speaker 3
Yes, she was Carmen, and they repeated her for Gilardo, and she died.
[00:02:34.330] - Speaker 2
And would you also trust other hospitals to cure snake bites? I don't think so.
[00:02:45.790] - Speaker 3
No, there's nothing wrong with it.
[00:02:47.290] - Speaker 2
Okay.
[00:02:48.100] - Speaker 3
No, they don't. No, they don't. No, they don't. No, they don't. No, they don't. No, they don't have any progress either.
[00:02:49.670] - Speaker 2
And where do you feel you are most likely to be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:02:59.000] - Speaker 3
I think that the snake When I've seen them kill a snake on the road, on the road, because then the cars run them over.
[00:03:04.680] - Speaker 2
And can you identify six poisonous and non-poisonous snakes?
[00:03:12.830] - Speaker 3
I've learned a little bit, people have taught me. He taught me which snake he sees most often, or rather, he was born in a geographical area where he saw it a lot, and there's also a program in the United States that teaches you which snakes are the most poisonous. Something like that. But seeing it here, no. Here, the most you see is the rattlesnake and the X-shaped mark.
[00:03:33.890] - Speaker 1
Size X and
[00:03:36.450] - Speaker 3
That baby. The baby and the
[00:03:39.670] - Speaker 1
And what? The choir.
[00:03:42.070] - Speaker 3
Here, in the videos The babuca. And what kind of snake is that? It's a green snake that lives in vines, which they call bejuca, and it flies. That's the one that doesn't bite. But anyway, all colera bite, except for one that has poison that is toxic, and another that doesn't. Cascabel, which is quite common around here. And size X. And how do you identify the snakes? The rattlesnake, by its color, because it was gray with lighter stripes underneath, white, in a ladder pattern. And the talla X is practically the same, with a stripe on top. It's similar, almost. It's almost like what the locals say, that the X is crossed with cascabé, with talla X, right? That's what they say around here, I don't know.
[00:04:44.970] - Speaker 2
And do you know of any cases of snakebite?
[00:04:49.500] - Speaker 3
I was already telling you about the case where you got the
[00:04:52.310] - Speaker 2
Yes, your friend. And what happened to them?
[00:04:57.490] - Speaker 3
Size X, the morning toothache, and Yes, between 1:00 and 1:30 it was me, I know it was.
[00:05:03.020] - Speaker 2
And did she get the antidote? I don't know, I have no idea. Okay. Was it a poisonous snake? Yes. And did she die? I'm so sorry, that's so sad.
[00:05:18.690] - Speaker 1
She died, they let her die, because I've always heard that there's an antidote, tuero and all that stuff, even if it's some kind of weed or whatever, they always give it to her, I don't know what the hell it is, but they give her tuero, it has an antidote, but they fired the woman, what happened, but the truth is that they let her die. That's how hospitals are these days. Well, you might as well go to the hospital if you're really sick. You don't even have to go to the hospital anymore. It's better to die in jail. You get to the hospital, and they're going to leave you in bad shape. Anything else?
[00:05:57.410] - Speaker 2
And no, I don't have any more questions, but do you have anything else to say about snakes? No. Your knowledge?
[00:06:04.360] - Speaker 1
No, he imagines all of us, because there's half of everything there. But not half. He has to eat the hen and the chickens.
[00:06:10.770] - Speaker 3
Halfway through, yes, quite a lot, but no, that's not one of them.
[00:06:12.980] - Speaker 1
But I don't kill them, I never like to kill a cilebra. After the fiercest cilebra, I scare it away, but I never kill one.
[00:06:24.960] - Speaker 2
And yes, the most important information after a snake bite is: Is it important to go straight to the hospital?
[00:06:31.960] - Speaker 1
Yes, because they supposedly say that it's best to go to a midwife, but that's not the case, you know, right? Yes. Because at the midwife's, they say that it's one woman, that they attend to you immediately, and that she explains things better.
[00:06:46.860] - Speaker 2
Yes, and it's also important to know which snake bites you, because there are different kinds
[00:06:53.600] - Speaker 1
That a person I've always said, someone who suddenly, but someone in a moment when they're bitten by it, doesn't see it. That's the most...
[00:07:05.020] - Speaker 2
Yes, it's a big problem.
[00:07:07.410] - Speaker 1
Exactly, because I can say: She bit me on the butt, and where is she now? At that point, I think I would start running, because she wouldn't be able to see me. Yes. So, that's what happens, it happens a lot. Then, a lot of times they say: No, the ones I see around here are corals, I've seen the candela. The cascabela, once they passed by here, I chased them away. I didn't kill them, because the truth is, they're just being themselves, right? Yes. But don't you Once you caught a little one too, it was big, it was always huge. I caught it, took it with me, and put it over there, rather. So it would come and eat the chickens, it always eats my chicks, I said no, I'm going to take it over there, but they killed it normally, I don't like to kill my mother. Thank goodness, not even them. That's how everything is, I say, I've always said: Well, it came out here, I found it here, brother, it gave me the opportunity.
[00:08:19.220] - Speaker 3
Did you kill the snake?
[00:08:20.320] - Speaker 1
I hit him on the head. But if I go to that hill, I'll be out there in the hills, what am I going to do in the hills? Brother, a culera could eat me. And she's in her Casi, her house too. So, it's like a stroke of luck when someone comes along, because there are a lot of them around here, but there are so many cascabel. And there are very few of them now, but there are a lot of rattles, those animals, all over the place. But then, we haven't seen the first case. Thank God, we haven't seen a case where we've had one of those. Never. Thank God around here, I've never had to take anyone to the hospital for that. Whenever there's an accident involving someone in the area, I always take them to the hospital. What we do have around here are bee stings. People have been stung by bees, which can also happen in the mountains. They can be spraying something and then the bees attack them because they're angry.
[00:09:24.582] - Speaker 1
But in terms of snakes, yes, a little lamb, my son, around here, no. They catch them and put them in suitcases and sell them.
[00:09:33.550] - Speaker 1
I say: But why do you catch them? Let them go. But no, here people sometimes catch them to sell them. I say it a lot: But what's the point, look at them. And I've always said: An animal is quiet, it stays still. Because you never shoot a cascabela. If she's not trained and you don't fight her, you never shoot her. The only thing that makes them run is their size. They don't want to talk. Don't be a bullfighter, don't be a bullfighter. And once they're ready, one strike and they're done. But the little ones, no, they run away. They've already left. So you know they're there. Then you come and make a little noise, and they're gone. But the talla, no, the talla stays there. Here, throw some fire at her. She'll die there with the fire. She didn't run away from you. She chases you away first. I like to see her when she has that little bell that they start ringing for her, when they're around her, when they haven't done anything to her yet.
[00:10:53.696] - Speaker 1
That's all.
[00:10:55.190] - Speaker 2
Yes. Well, thank you very much. Yes, thank you very much for your time and your knowledge, it's very important. Yes. Thank you very much.
[00:11:04.490] - Speaker 1
Also, I'm the president here, on the Bolivia neighborhood council. Yes. This is called Picalara, right? No, Bolivia neighborhood. Bolivia.
