[00:00:03.170] - Speaker 2
My name is María Chorani Moreno.
[00:00:05.260] - Speaker 1
And how old are you?
[00:00:06.580] - Speaker 2
23.
[00:00:07.900] - Speaker 1
And what do you do for a living?
[00:00:10.140] - Speaker 2
I work here at the hardware store.
[00:00:12.930] - Speaker 1
Are you married or single?
[00:00:15.900] - Speaker 2
Married, no. I'm in a relationship, but I'm not married.
[00:00:19.890] - Speaker 1
And do you have children? Yes. And how many years have you lived in El Carmen?
[00:00:27.120] - Speaker 2
Since I was born.
[00:00:30.340] - Speaker 1
And do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:36.390] - Speaker 2
I've seen them several times already.
[00:00:40.740] - Speaker 1
And have any of your animals ever been bitten by a snake?
[00:00:47.950] - Speaker 2
Not at the moment, as I don't have any pets.
[00:00:51.460] - Speaker 1
And do you know how to prevent or avoid a snake bite before you get bitten?
[00:01:00.890] - Speaker 2
Preventing it, no, because you're not paying attention and you can't attack the snake and then there's nothing you can do, it bites you. And to prevent the poison from spreading throughout your body, you tie something around the bite. That really helps prevent the poison from spreading through your body. That's what they taught me.
[00:01:29.920] - Speaker 1
Exactly, yes. And what would you do if a snake bit you?
[00:01:35.290] - Speaker 2
Well, if it's out here in the countryside and I see that it's difficult for me to get to the town or the hospital, the only thing I would do is tie myself where it bit me and see how I can get to the hospital.
[00:01:52.450] - Speaker 1
And which hospital?
[00:01:54.890] - Speaker 2
The one in Carmen was called Nuestra Señora del Carmen.
[00:01:58.200] - Speaker 1
And what would you do at the hospital in Carmen to treat a snake bite?
[00:02:04.160] - Speaker 2
No, very much. I would request to be transferred to another location.
[00:02:10.160] - Speaker 1
So, would you trust other hospitals to treat you? Which ones?
[00:02:14.960] - Speaker 2
For example, Girardó, which is really good. There are more doctors there and they treat people better. And where do you feel it hurts the most when you get bitten by a snake?
[00:02:31.220] - Speaker 1
In the countryside or at home?
[00:02:33.690] - Speaker 2
Well, here, wherever. Here, with this heat, they go inside their houses.
[00:02:40.960] - Speaker 1
Sure, yes. And can you tell the difference between poisonous and non-poisonous snakes?
[00:02:48.080] - Speaker 2
Well, there are some. The poisonous ones, she says, are the cascabé, the coral, and others that I don't know the name of, but I've seen them. And the ones that aren't poisonous are the ones that eat like little bugs, the eggs, which are spicy, but they're not poisonous. And they wrap themselves up.
[00:03:14.810] - Speaker 1
And how do you identify poisonous snakes?
[00:03:20.770] - Speaker 2
Well, the only ones I can identify as poisonous are the coral rattlesnake, because of their color and because I know they are poisonous. They are the most common ones here.
[00:03:35.320] - Speaker 1
And do you know of any cases of snake bites?
[00:03:40.200] - Speaker 2
No, not yet, not yet.
[00:03:43.590] - Speaker 1
What if you need to go to the hospital? Is that difficult for you or easy?
[00:03:49.210] - Speaker 2
Difficult, of course. Why? Sometimes transportation. Sometimes you have it, sometimes you don't. Let's say your transportation breaks down, your motorcycle, imagine, you're up there, far from the farm, how are you going to get here? And I struggle, because that's always complicated.
[00:04:06.870] - Speaker 1
Yes, of course. Well, I don't have any more questions, but do you have anything else to say about snakes or your knowledge?
[00:04:17.130] - Speaker 2
No.
[00:04:19.000] - Speaker 1
And the most important information is that after a snake bite, it is important to go straight to the hospital. It is also important to know what kind of snake bit you, because there are different antidotes. You can take a photo of the snake or you can take it to the hospital, kill it, and bring it with you. Well, thank you very much.
[00:04:46.440] - Speaker 2
You're welcome. All done.
