And do you know what medicine they recommend? No, apart from that. I have high blood sugar, so they told me to take boruco bile, and that's what I take. To lower your blood sugar? Yes. Five drops in a shot of wine.
[00:00:15.430] - Speaker 1
Because of snake bites?
[00:00:17.660] - Speaker 2
Yes, it can be used for that too.
[00:00:19.410] - Speaker 1
By others too?
[00:00:21.790] - Speaker 2
Yes. That boruco bile is useful; it's the antidote for snake bites.
[00:00:29.150] - Speaker 1
And why else?
[00:00:30.380] - Speaker 2
Because, for example, when the boruja no longer has bile, it means that the snakes have bitten it a lot. The same goes for deer: where there are deer, there are rattlesnakes. And that also causes bile. They say it's the opposite of that.
[00:00:51.570] - Speaker 1
Yes, interesting.
[00:00:52.890] - Speaker 2
Yes. I heard there's a coral, but it's huge, with a crest. I didn't know. Many years ago, supposedly with a crest. Like the crest on a lizard, over its head. Yes, yes. Something like that. I didn't see it, but I heard about it. It must be true? Could it be? Otherwise, around here, there's the bejuca, the cazadora, the mitado, which is I mean, if you don't know them, of course you're going to be scared, because the mitado is a thick snake. But harmless, let's say. Yes, not that. Clean up, because there are mice and all that stuff. What else? Yes, there are some thick ones, but no... Around here, the talla and the coral. Plus more penises, right?
[00:01:52.180] - Speaker 1
Yes, of course. And the cascarilla. Yes, of course.
[00:01:55.860] - Speaker 2
You can't see the rest, not the pehuca. Of course, yes.
[00:02:00.110] - Speaker 1
Thank you very much for your insight.
