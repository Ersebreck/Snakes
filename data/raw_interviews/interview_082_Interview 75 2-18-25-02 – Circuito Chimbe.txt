[00:00:12.980] - Speaker 1
And do you have children? Yes. And how many years have you lived here in the market?
[00:00:19.200] - Speaker 2
No, here, in this town, here in Chile, I've only been here for about a month and a half.
[00:00:24.400] - Speaker 1
So, do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:31.550] - Speaker 2
Yes. Why? One jump in the woods, and with that rain, they move around a lot.
[00:00:38.140] - Speaker 1
And has any of your animals ever been a snake?
[00:00:45.010] - Speaker 2
But not here in this town, but in another town, in Chocón, Uncle, not around here.
[00:00:52.650] - Speaker 1
And do you know how to prevent or avoid a snake bite?
[00:00:57.470] - Speaker 2
I've seen that they suck where they don't bite, they suck the blood, well, they suck there and throw it away and take it And they tie up the leg where the bite is and take it as quickly as they can because it's urgent.
[00:01:10.880] - Speaker 1
And before a bite, do you know how to prevent or avoid snakes before they bite?
[00:01:20.290] - Speaker 2
Charming her, throwing himself at her feet. Charming her. Of course.
[00:01:24.820] - Speaker 1
And what would you do if a snake bit you?
[00:01:29.390] - Speaker 2
I would tie myself up and access myself and call for help, so that they would come quickly to my aid.
[00:01:40.160] - Speaker 1
And would you trust the nearest hospital here to treat a snake bite?
[00:01:46.440] - Speaker 2
Nothing closer in Melgar.
[00:01:48.280] - Speaker 1
Would you trust the hospital in Melgar? Yes, I would, because you're the only one.
[00:01:53.730] - Speaker 2
And would you trust other hospitals as well?
[00:02:00.240] - Speaker 1
Yes. Okay. And where do you feel most likely to be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:02:08.990] - Speaker 2
In the countryside.
[00:02:09.940] - Speaker 1
Why?
[00:02:10.180] - Speaker 2
Because it's more obvious that there are more animals around. At home, though, you keep cleaning and moving things around, so it's hard for them to hide.
[00:02:21.910] - Speaker 1
Yes. And do you know how to identify poisonous and non-poisonous snakes?
[00:02:29.470] - Speaker 2
Not anymore.
[00:02:30.900] - Speaker 1
Yes, it's not difficult.
[00:02:32.820] - Speaker 2
Not anymore, because I used to live on a banana plantation and you could tell which one was yours by the tail, because they had a little mark on their tails or some were striped, but now there are so many different species that you get confused. Not anymore, to be honest, not anymore.
[00:02:49.290] - Speaker 1
Okay, yes. And do you know of a case of a snake bite? My uncle does.
[00:02:55.390] - Speaker 2
Okay. It bit him, even though he was restless, because he stuck his leg in a hole, and then the snake got halfway up his leg. They had to take him to the hospital and amputate his leg. Okay. But if not, he'd still be
[00:03:12.370] - Speaker 1
And did he die? No.
[00:03:13.970] - Speaker 2
Thank God he lived, but he lost a foot. They had to amputate his leg because it was bitten by a large snake. How awful.
[00:03:24.270] - Speaker 1
And also, if you need to go to the hospital, is that difficult for you or easy?
[00:03:31.210] - Speaker 2
Well, if my partner is there, it's easy because he has a car and understands me.
[00:03:37.200] - Speaker 1
Well, I don't have any more questions, but do you have anything else to say about snakes or your knowledge? Anything else?
[00:03:44.850] - Speaker 2
No, not like that. Perfect.
[00:03:47.500] - Speaker 1
And yes, the most important information is that after a snake bite, it is important to go straight to the hospital and it is important to know what kind of snake bit you.
[00:04:03.170] - Speaker 2
Yes, I have been told that when a snake bites you, it is good to observe what kind it is, although I don't think you remember much because of the pain, but you try to remember as best you can. That way they know what to do, because some are more poisonous than others.
[00:04:19.390] - Speaker 1
Yes, also. And there are different anti-physics for different snakes.
[00:04:23.810] - Speaker 2
And the problem is that some bodies accept it more than others, that not all bodies will react the same way to bites. That's the other thing.
[00:04:33.580] - Speaker 1
Yes. Well, thank you very much for your time. That's all I have.
[00:04:37.290] - Speaker 2
She doesn't speak Spanish very well, how funny. Yes, she speaks it very well.
[00:04:44.230] - Speaker 1
Thank you. Okay.
