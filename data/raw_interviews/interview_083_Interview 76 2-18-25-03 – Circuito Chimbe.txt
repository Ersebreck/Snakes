[00:00:31.470] - Speaker 1
So, do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:37.180] - Speaker 2
It could be very likely due to the location.
[00:00:41.850] - Speaker 1
Why? Yes, there are many snakes, yes. Have any of your animals been bitten by a snake? No. No? Good. And do you know how to prevent a snake bite?
[00:01:00.050] - Speaker 2
No.
[00:01:03.530] - Speaker 1
Okay, yes. And what would you do if a snake bit you?
[00:01:08.800] - Speaker 2
Well, the most immediate thing to do is go to the nearest emergency room. Because I don't know how to drive, I wouldn't know how to get there.
[00:01:20.800] - Speaker 1
Yes. And the nearest hospital is Melgar? Melgar. Okay. So would you trust the hospital in Melgar to treat a snake bite?
[00:01:34.010] - Speaker 2
I wouldn't stay any longer.
[00:01:39.350] - Speaker 1
And would you trust other hospitals to cure one too?
[00:01:43.990] - Speaker 2
I understand that the hospital or the other place is the Tolemaida base, but admission there isn't like just saying, "Let's go there." You have to be admitted to the hospital, and then they do whatever they do I don't know what they call it. They make arrangements for the antidotes.
[00:02:07.950] - Speaker 1
Yes, okay. And if you need to go to the hospital, is that difficult for you or is it easy?
[00:02:17.890] - Speaker 2
Well, I have a vehicle.
[00:02:19.710] - Speaker 1
Is it more or less easy?
[00:02:21.760] - Speaker 2
Yes, it's essential, yes ma'am.
[00:02:23.610] - Speaker 1
And where do you feel you are most likely to be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home? In the countryside. Why?
[00:02:34.390] - Speaker 2
Because of the vegetation. It's like their habitat.
[00:02:43.210] - Speaker 1
Sure. And do you know how to tell if snakes are poisonous or venomous?
[00:02:50.340] - Speaker 2
Poisonous ones, I know the coral one, the size X one, and there's one they used to call, which I know from when I was a child, but I don't see it anymore. One they called Toche, that's what my grandparents called it. She's yellow with black, and she's very poisonous when you don't see her. So, those are the only ones I recognize. There are others I've seen, but I wouldn't know if they're poisonous or not.
[00:03:22.700] - Speaker 1
And how do you identify snakes? By their color. And do you know of any cases of snake bites?
[00:03:39.000] - Speaker 2
No, ma'am.
[00:03:40.590] - Speaker 1
Well, I don't have any more questions for you. Do you have anything else to say about snakes or your knowledge of snakes or anything else?
[00:03:50.670] - Speaker 2
No, not really as knowledge, no.
[00:03:55.050] - Speaker 1
And, well, the most important information is that after a snake bite, it is important to go straight to the hospital. It is also important to know what kind of snake bit you, because there are different antidotes for different venoms.
[00:04:15.440] - Speaker 2
Depending on which one it was.
[00:04:18.180] - Speaker 1
Yes. That's all I have. Thank you very much for your time.
