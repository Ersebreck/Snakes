Yes.
[00:00:33.530] - Speaker 1
Okay. Why?
[00:00:34.730] - Speaker 2
So we are exposed on a large piece of land, where there is open countryside, lots of hills, and lots of vegetation.
[00:00:41.810] - Speaker 1
Yes, okay. Have any of your animals ever been bitten by a snake? No. Do you know how to prevent or avoid snake bites?
[00:00:56.710] - Speaker 2
Not as such.
[00:00:58.960] - Speaker 1
Okay. And what would you do if a snake bit you?
[00:01:04.440] - Speaker 2
First and foremost, call an ambulance. Help, because—Orrela, doctor. Yes, that's the best thing to do
[00:01:12.180] - Speaker 1
And would you trust the nearest hospital here to treat a snake bite? Yes. And would you trust the other hospitals as well? Yes, I would. And where do you feel it is most likely to happen? And why would you be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:01:33.750] - Speaker 2
In the courtyard, which is the field.
[00:01:35.560] - Speaker 1
Okay, yes. Why?
[00:01:37.810] - Speaker 2
Because that's where most people are. Where are most people?
[00:01:44.340] - Speaker 1
Yes. Do you know how to identify poisonous snakes or snakes that are venomous?
[00:01:52.200] - Speaker 2
Some do. Some do identify themselves.
[00:01:55.940] - Speaker 1
And how do you identify snakes?
[00:01:58.640] - Speaker 2
Because of the colors. I know that the ones with bright colors are the most poisonous.
[00:02:05.440] - Speaker 1
And do you know of any cases of snake bites?
[00:02:09.100] - Speaker 2
No, not here. Recently with us? No.
[00:02:13.220] - Speaker 1
And if you need to go to the hospital, is it easy for you or difficult?
[00:02:20.820] - Speaker 2
We have our own transportation, because we are always away from the hospital.
[00:02:27.920] - Speaker 1
I have no further questions, but do you have anything else to say about snakes or your knowledge of snakes, or anything else?
[00:02:38.240] - Speaker 2
Generally, here, because it's a sidewalk, as I said, because it's a green area, we do find one or two. We've even found them on the road, but let's say that you identify them or move them to one side, or if you know what to do, you just pick them up. Remove them because they're dangerous for children. Yes, of course. Of course. Yes, of course.
[00:03:00.670] - Speaker 1
Well, the most important information is that after a snake bite, go straight to the hospital to see a doctor. And it's important to know what kind of snake bit you, because there are different antivenoms for different snakes. And yes, that's all I have. Thank you very much. No, you're welcome. Thank you.
