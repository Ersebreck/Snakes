Yes, of course.
[00:00:37.810] - Speaker 1
And how many years have you lived in El Carmen? Or here? Here, in my place. In my place, yes. All my life. Okay. And so, do you think it's likely that you'll be bitten by a snake? Yes, of course. Why?
[00:00:50.470] - Speaker 2
Because I'm willing, because I fish, I hunt, all that. That's where I live, working in the fields.
[00:00:56.650] - Speaker 1
Have any of your animals ever been bitten by a snake? No. No? And do you know how to prevent or avoid a snake bite?
[00:01:07.650] - Speaker 2
There are many qualities. There are many ways. One, cutting the wound, sucking out the blood. Two, with petroleum. Three, with antidotes, if it arrives suddenly and early at the clinic, at first aid.
[00:01:27.850] - Speaker 1
Okay. And also, before a bite, do you have any methods to prevent bites?
[00:01:39.630] - Speaker 2
No, just be alert, stay alert. Because snakes don't attack if you don't bother them.
[00:01:45.670] - Speaker 1
Yes, it's true. Yes. And what would you do if a snake bit you?
[00:01:53.630] - Speaker 2
Well, do whatever methods I have available. OK. Draw blood or find someone who is very good at it. Drink it, dry yourself off, drink it, and apply a tourniquet so that the blood doesn't circulate. Yes, OK. So that the poison doesn't circulate.
[00:02:10.600] - Speaker 1
And if you went to the nearest hospital here, would you trust the hospital to cure you?
[00:02:19.160] - Speaker 2
Yes, of course you have to trust the clinic or the hospital or the first aid clinic, like here, because this isn't a hospital, it's a What do you call this? What is this? I can't remember right now. I mean, it's not a hospital yet. Because here in Melgar, it's still a developed town and there isn't a hospital. This is first aid. I've known about it all my life.
[00:02:55.010] - Speaker 1
And if you need to go to the hospital, is that difficult for you or easy?
[00:03:04.660] - Speaker 2
Well, here, suddenly, it's a little difficult because of transportation. If you have to transport someone suddenly, you would have to call an ambulance or the fire department, whatever, to transport them. And where do you feel most likely to be bitten by a snake?
[00:03:21.650] - Speaker 1
In the countryside or at home?
[00:03:23.990] - Speaker 2
Well, right now, here, in this place, let's say, it's still the countryside. We're ready at any moment for a snake bite.
[00:03:30.120] - Speaker 1
Okay. And why is that?
[00:03:32.740] - Speaker 2
Because there's a lot of it around here.
[00:03:35.320] - Speaker 1
And do you know how to identify poisonous snakes or non-poisonous snakes? Yes, of course. And how do you identify snakes?
[00:03:42.150] - Speaker 2
There is the size X, which they call four noses. Well, there is the rattlesnake. There is the coral snake, the chili pepper tail. The size zapa. There is the rotten size. Among the snakes there is the hunter, there is the mitau perdicero, which are not dangerous. They are the only two that are not dangerous, the hunter and the mitau.
[00:04:13.510] - Speaker 1
And how do you identify snakes? By their color and by
[00:04:21.020] - Speaker 2
The color and any stripes or lines it has. And the shape, and if you can catch it, examine it and see its canines. Yes.
[00:04:29.820] - Speaker 1
Yes, if you can, yes.
[00:04:32.570] - Speaker 2
The snake that is not fierce has no fangs, only a hood.
[00:04:39.770] - Speaker 1
And do you know of a case of someone dying from a snake bite? I do. Okay. That's terrible. What happened?
[00:04:49.790] - Speaker 2
No, I treated it myself with petroleum, bloodletting, and a tourniquet. First aid in the field.
[00:04:59.380] - Speaker 1
And which one? And it suddenly bit you?
[00:05:01.430] - Speaker 2
One size.
[00:05:03.160] - Speaker 1
How many years ago?
[00:05:05.370] - Speaker 2
No, I was about 14 years old.
[00:05:09.550] - Speaker 1
Did you go to the doctor or not? No.
[00:05:12.670] - Speaker 2
No, when I arrived, yes, I went to the doctor, but after about three days, but not anymore They did give me the antidote and everything, but it has cleared up a little, so it didn't affect me much. Although it did affect me a little, but not a lot, because my leg was numb for three months. My leg was paralyzed.
[00:05:33.270] - Speaker 1
Okay, seriously. But you're better now, after all.
[00:05:39.530] - Speaker 2
No, the lasting effects are a bad temper and anger, due to the effects of the poison.
[00:05:47.810] - Speaker 1
Yes, okay. And the bite happened in the field? In the field, picking coffee. And you stepped on it? The bite? Yes. The bite?
[00:06:02.470] - Speaker 2
No, I stepped over her foot. But then, she had stepped over people there and was towered over, as we say. She was where I stepped.
[00:06:14.700] - Speaker 1
And did he kill the snake? Or did he Yes, I'm sorry. He killed the snake.
[00:06:26.020] - Speaker 2
Yes, that's right.
[00:06:27.290] - Speaker 1
And did I take a photo? T Like a photo of the snake?
[00:06:32.380] - Speaker 2
No, very difficult, because cameras didn't exist at that time.
[00:06:35.180] - Speaker 1
Sure. No cell phones or anything.
[00:06:39.540] - Speaker 2
Barely a telephone, and you had to travel four hours to make a call. Okay, sure. Yes.
[00:06:44.270] - Speaker 1
And other people, do they see the snake too, the carving? Or you, in my case, the snake?
[00:07:03.720] - Speaker 2
I'm sorry. Whatever it is, I can identify it. Whether it's coral or carving, whatever I tell you. I'll tell you: That's such and such. This is the barroja de jí, this is the candela, this is the tintina, this is the carving we call What? The carving... I forgot the name of that one. In any case, whatever it is, I'll tell you what it is.
[00:07:37.910] - Speaker 1
Okay. Well, thank goodness, that's better. And well, I don't have any more questions, but do you have anything else to say about snakes or your experiences?
[00:07:49.520] - Speaker 2
Well, in my experience, I've seen snakes many times. They've chased me because there's one that chases you, which is the talla tochi or culebra toche, as we call it, a hunter. You can't throw a stick or anything at it because it has to run. We chase it wherever it goes. Yes, it chases you. It has chased me a few times. But as long as you pass by and don't do anything to it, it stays still and doesn't bother me. That's why there's a saying: Leave things alone, if it's still, it's safe.
[00:08:28.240] - Speaker 1
Well, thank you very much for your time.
[00:08:31.100] - Speaker 2
That's all I have. Sorry, I don't know much about that, do I?
[00:08:34.110] - Speaker 1
Yes, I think so, yes.
[00:08:37.810] - Speaker 2
If they answered all your questions, I don't think so. It says on the cell phone: I don't think so. Yes. Look, woman. Yes? Okay, yes, ma'am.
[00:08:53.730] - Speaker 1
Yes, thank you very much. You're welcome, thank you, Fidel.
[00:08:55.310] - Speaker 2
Yes, he's been bitten by a venomous insect. I told the lady, "I don't know anything about that. I've been bitten by one and bitten by two." Yes? Yes, by two more, so three. One bit me halfway, but that just makes it close up. It just cuts it off. And the hunter does the same thing. She bites, but she doesn't have any venom.
[00:09:19.190] - Speaker 1
Yes, yes, yes. Very kind, very important. Yes, yes, thank you very much. Thank you very much, very kind. See you later.
