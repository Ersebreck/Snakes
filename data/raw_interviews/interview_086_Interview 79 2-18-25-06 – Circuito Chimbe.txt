[00:00:00.000] - Speaker 2
Yes? Yes. Thank you. And what is your name? Josebardo Guerra. And how old are you?
[00:00:10.040] - Speaker 1
Thirty-two.
[00:00:11.310] - Speaker 2
And what do you do for a living?
[00:00:13.020] - Speaker 1
We are in the process of renovating, it is called.
[00:00:16.640] - Speaker 2
Are you married or single? Single. Do you have children?
[00:00:21.420] - Speaker 1
No.
[00:00:22.370] - Speaker 2
And how many years ago? He called me Dad. And how many years have you lived here? You live here?
[00:00:31.000] - Speaker 1
Today is yesterday. Okay.
[00:00:33.300] - Speaker 2
So, do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:38.000] - Speaker 1
Yes, of course, because in rural areas it's more common to see tailgating, let's say.
[00:00:45.270] - Speaker 2
And have any of your animals ever been bitten by a snake? No.
[00:00:51.700] - Speaker 1
Okay.
[00:00:53.250] - Speaker 2
And do you know how to prevent a snake bite?
[00:00:57.220] - Speaker 1
No, but at this time, the precaution one takes is to wear appropriate footwear if walking around in wooded areas, as one would normally wear sturdier shoes because rubber trees can be found anywhere.
[00:01:11.420] - Speaker 2
Yes.
[00:01:12.800] - Speaker 1
It could be the precautions we took here, right? I mean, the countryside, wearing proper footwear.
[00:01:17.660] - Speaker 2
Yes, in the countryside, at home too. And what would you do if a snake bit you?
[00:01:25.040] - Speaker 1
In that case, you should go to the nearest medical center.
[00:01:28.250] - Speaker 2
And which doctor is closest? Medgar. And would you trust the hospital, Medgar, to treat a snake bite?
[00:01:35.640] - Speaker 1
So, that was the option, or turn everything around, but let's say, yes, of course. Because medicine, self-medication would be a good decision, because they don't know at the time what the hell it was or anything like that. So, that brings us to their measure and they take, well, more or less, what the hell it was.
[00:01:54.640] - Speaker 2
And where do you feel that? And are you more likely to get bitten by a snake in the countryside or at home?
[00:02:04.770] - Speaker 1
No, in the countryside. Why? Because houses are usually fumigated. Make sure the doors are closed so that large animals cannot get in. And in the countryside, yes, because obviously you won't have to help her chase them away.
[00:02:24.420] - Speaker 2
And do you know how to identify poisonous snakes or snakes that are venomous?
[00:02:31.690] - Speaker 1
More or less.
[00:02:32.790] - Speaker 2
Okay, yes.
[00:02:33.800] - Speaker 1
The most common ones you see around, because you see them on television, but the rest, the ones you remember in your mind's eye, are those.
[00:02:41.520] - Speaker 2
And how do you identify the different snakes? By the colors and shape of their skin, for example, the patterns they have.
[00:02:51.540] - Speaker 1
Yes, okay.
[00:02:53.160] - Speaker 2
And do you know of a case of snake love?
[00:02:57.260] - Speaker 1
Yes, no. Okay. From firsthand experience, no. I've heard, for example, that in some areas it did cause damage, but I've never seen a friendship like that, where it has affected someone.
[00:03:12.800] - Speaker 2
Well, no. And if you need to go to the hospital, is that difficult for you or easy?
[00:03:20.670] - Speaker 1
No, it's easy here. Okay.
[00:03:23.120] - Speaker 2
Yes, I don't have any more questions, but do you have anything else to say about snakes or your knowledge of snakes?
[00:03:29.870] - Speaker 1
Of my colleagues, yes, I'm talking about the store.
[00:03:36.980] - Speaker 2
Okay, fine.
[00:03:38.290] - Speaker 1
Because enough is enough. I've got the burns.
[00:03:42.900] - Speaker 2
And the most important information is that after a bite, it is important to go to the hospital and it is important to know what kind of snake bit you, because there are different antivenoms. Well, thank you very much. You're welcome.
