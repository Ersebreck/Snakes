[00:00:21.900] - Speaker 3
And you?
[00:00:24.120] - Speaker 1
Me home, please.
[00:00:26.760] - Speaker 3
Are you married or single? Married.
[00:00:30.380] - Speaker 1
I am a widow.
[00:00:33.220] - Speaker 3
And how many years have you lived here?
[00:00:37.580] - Speaker 2
Four months here. And you?
[00:00:40.330] - Speaker 1
Same.
[00:00:44.320] - Speaker 3
So, do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:50.080] - Speaker 2
Yes, of course. That could be.
[00:00:52.760] - Speaker 3
Why?
[00:00:53.410] - Speaker 2
Because I've already seen three in the last four months. Almost one a month. Yes, almost one.
[00:01:02.330] - Speaker 3
And do you know how to prevent or avoid a snake bite?
[00:01:11.180] - Speaker 2
I think by keeping the area around the house clean. Yes, keeping it clean, not going into places full of— Weeds. Weeds. That's the only thing I did.
[00:01:33.110] - Speaker 3
Okay, yes.
[00:01:35.010] - Speaker 1
Yes, that could also be the case. They say that sprinkling Creolina around the house, which has a strong odor, will prevent snakes from suddenly entering the house, because they might otherwise enter the house.
[00:01:46.930] - Speaker 3
Yes. And have any of your animals ever been bitten by a snake?
[00:01:53.510] - Speaker 2
A relative.
[00:01:54.830] - Speaker 3
Any animals?
[00:01:56.030] - Speaker 2
Not here?
[00:01:59.670] - Speaker 3
No, okay. And what would you do if a snake died?
[00:02:06.350] - Speaker 2
I'm scared to death. I'm not dying. I would run to the hospital, even though it's far away.
[00:02:17.030] - Speaker 1
Yes, that's the problem, you always look for the place closest to a hospital, but the problem is that we're always far away.
[00:02:26.290] - Speaker 3
So, it's difficult if you need to go to the hospital. Sometimes it's difficult to go.
[00:02:33.710] - Speaker 2
I would need a vehicle and help from neighbors.
[00:02:39.520] - Speaker 3
And would you trust the nearest hospital here to treat a snake bite?
[00:02:48.020] - Speaker 2
I would go, but I wouldn't trust it, because it's a top-level hospital, but it only provides emergency care; there are no specialists. It's a top-level hospital. The most advanced hospitals with professionals are in Girardot.
[00:03:06.690] - Speaker 3
And also
[00:03:09.960] - Speaker 1
Yes, the same, because here the hospital is practically like a health center. They just put people on an IV, give them medicine to relieve the pain, but there are no specialists. You feel unsafe there if you have a serious condition.
[00:03:32.940] - Speaker 3
But would you trust other hospitals?
[00:03:38.340] - Speaker 1
Yes, of course.
[00:03:40.280] - Speaker 2
I would get there quickly to receive first aid. And where do you feel most likely to be bitten by a snake?
[00:03:50.520] - Speaker 3
In the countryside or in the city? In the countryside. Why? What was the name of the town that was there before?
[00:03:59.000] - Speaker 2
Why? Where are they? On the right. But I'm scared in the house, because when it rains a lot, they say they look for a dry place.
[00:04:08.770] - Speaker 3
Yes.
[00:04:09.170] - Speaker 1
Or also when it's very hot. They also look for cool places and the children's house, I think it's like a special place.
[00:04:20.070] - Speaker 3
Can you tell if a snake is poisonous or non-poisonous?
[00:04:26.450] - Speaker 1
No. That's what we'd like to know, to identify what they are. When a snake bites someone, you can tell if it's poisonous or not, but we don't know. I think the little I know is based on the shape of the head.
[00:04:41.920] - Speaker 2
As a child, I was taught that some have heads, and when they are very round, they said they were not so dangerous, but when they have a long head and a nose, they said they were dangerous. For example, the ones you see on the little trees that are completely green, they say those are not dangerous and do not attack, they are only herbivores.
[00:05:10.450] - Speaker 3
And do you know of a case of a rural woman who is? Yes, I do.
[00:05:20.460] - Speaker 2
My family, my mom, my brother, they live in the countryside, but in Venezuela, in the countryside. And also in Colombia, but in northern Santander. And there have been snake bites there.
[00:05:33.500] - Speaker 3
And did the bites happen in the field?
[00:05:40.450] - Speaker 2
Yes, in the countryside.
[00:05:41.520] - Speaker 3
They are farmers working, they were found. And did they go to the hospital? No.
[00:05:51.610] - Speaker 2
Not both times. My dad with his plants and stuff got better.
[00:05:57.730] - Speaker 3
And were the snakes poisonous or not?
[00:06:01.730] - Speaker 2
Yes. Poisonous.
[00:06:06.080] - Speaker 3
And do you also know of a case involving a girl?
[00:06:08.750] - Speaker 1
No, I don't know of any cases. I do know that my brother, who used to live here, had cattle and a cow was killed, something like that, by a snake. But not a person.
[00:06:25.640] - Speaker 3
Well, I don't have any more questions, but do you have anything else to say about snakes or your knowledge of snakes or anything else?
[00:06:36.430] - Speaker 2
Are we curious?
[00:06:38.570] - Speaker 3
No, no more about snakes. Okay, more information. Whether you have it or not, it's fine.
[00:06:45.820] - Speaker 2
No, what I really want to know is if there are many poisonous snakes and how to identify them. I would like to know.
[00:06:54.150] - Speaker 1
Yes, because look, when we go out for a walk to exercise in the morning with my sister-in-law and the girls, we find them there, killed on the road. And then, yikes! No, it's terrible to see them there, some bigger, some smaller, and they're almost always the same color. There are snakes of that species around here, but I don't really know how poisonous they are.
[00:07:20.310] - Speaker 3
And yes, the most important information is that after a bite, it is important to go straight to the hospital and it is important to know what kind of snake bit you.
[00:07:34.770] - Speaker 2
Because there are different antivenoms for different snakes.
[00:07:40.190] - Speaker 3
And you can take a picture, you can kill her and take her to the hospital. Inda. Well, that's all I have. Thank you very much for your time. Okay.
[00:07:56.470] - Speaker 2
No, to be honest.
[00:07:57.940] - Speaker 1
Thanks to you.
