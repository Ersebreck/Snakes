[00:00:20.350] - Speaker 2
So, do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:25.270] - Speaker 1
Yes, there are possibilities. There are possibilities everywhere, of course.
[00:00:29.290] - Speaker 2
Okay, yes. And why is that possible, I think?
[00:00:34.170] - Speaker 1
Well, more than anything else, this is countryside. Yes. It's countryside and there are a lot of hills, for example, look at all the hills. So, that also contributes to the snakes being more prevalent in those areas.
[00:00:47.460] - Speaker 2
Yes. And have any of your animals ever been bitten by a snake? No, miss. Okay, fine.
[00:00:55.400] - Speaker 1
So far, nothing.
[00:00:57.560] - Speaker 2
Do you know how to prevent or avoid a snake bite?
[00:01:02.510] - Speaker 1
There are so many factors. Don't step on them, be very careful when walking.
[00:01:10.830] - Speaker 2
Yes, of course.
[00:01:12.120] - Speaker 1
Yes, miss.
[00:01:12.800] - Speaker 2
And what would you do if a snake bit you?
[00:01:17.990] - Speaker 1
I was going to say that the most feasible thing to do right away is to apply a tourniquet as soon as possible and go to the nearest doctor.
[00:01:26.650] - Speaker 2
And the nearest doctor is in Where is that?
[00:01:31.360] - Speaker 1
It's here, in Melgar.
[00:01:32.570] - Speaker 2
And would you trust the hospital in Melgar to treat a snake bite? What? I don't understand. Would you trust the hospital in Melgar to treat a snake bite?
[00:01:44.190] - Speaker 1
Well, trusting that they have the antivenom serum, the special one for snakes, I think so, of course, because the important thing is that they give you the antidote to the venom, that's the most important thing, because if they don't give you the antivenom serum, it's complicated. Yes, of course. And you know that there are snakes that can kill you in 10, 15, 20 minutes, depending on the type of snake.
[00:02:20.770] - Speaker 2
Yes.
[00:02:22.660] - Speaker 1
There are many snakes here, such as the X, the rattlesnake, the coral snake, the tall snake, the zapa, and one they call the pudridora. There are several different kinds.
[00:02:38.840] - Speaker 2
And if you need to go to the hospital, is that difficult for you or easy?
[00:02:44.560] - Speaker 1
Well, nowadays, if you have a motorcycle, it's easier to get there faster. If not, any neighbor who has a car or a motorcycle can take you there faster. You need an ambulance, and the ambulance comes, but the problem is that ambulance services take a long time. First, someone arrives, and then the ambulance has to arrive.
[00:03:07.060] - Speaker 2
And would you trust other hospitals to treat snake bites?
[00:03:13.610] - Speaker 1
Yes, there is already a hospital that is more than third level, fourth level, which would be like Girardot, Espinal, Ibagué. So, those are already higher-level hospitals, more Yes, higher. Higher level.
[00:03:27.840] - Speaker 2
And where do you feel that's most likely to happen? In the country or in the city?
[00:03:36.370] - Speaker 1
Yes, that's right. Where you're most likely to find them is in houses, but sometimes you find them elsewhere too. It could be in the house or in the yard, anywhere is possible.
[00:03:49.810] - Speaker 2
Yes.
[00:03:50.450] - Speaker 1
Yes, you have to be careful.
[00:03:53.830] - Speaker 2
And do you know how to identify poisonous and non-poisonous snakes?
[00:04:00.420] - Speaker 1
Yes, of course. There are snakes that you know, for example, size X, the rattlesnake, the rotten one, the zapper, there's the The coral snake, there's the... I don't know, there are a lot of snakes that are very poisonous.
[00:04:19.790] - Speaker 2
And how do you identify the snakes? By their color, by bald spots? By color, yes.
[00:04:26.790] - Speaker 1
You can identify them by their color, size, and measurements. For example, the cascabela—you can always hear it jingling. The coral is red and has red ribbons. The size—you already know it because it's longer, cute, and has an X shape on top. For example, the zapa. The zapa, which they call zapa, is a snake that is short but thick and doesn't grow much.
[00:05:03.190] - Speaker 2
And do you know of a case of a snake with brown fur?
[00:05:07.200] - Speaker 1
No, not here in this area, it's not very common. I haven't been the first yet. Maybe many years ago, an uncle of mine was bitten, but he wasn't bitten here, he was bitten over there in a hotel. But that was many years ago.
[00:05:26.100] - Speaker 2
Well, I don't have any more questions. Do you have anything to say about snakes or your knowledge of snakes or anything else?
[00:05:36.010] - Speaker 1
No, miss, not at the moment. Those are the most common ones around here, the ones you see or have learned to name.
[00:05:43.540] - Speaker 2
And the most important information is to go straight to the hospital after a snake bite. Yes, ma'am. And it's important to know what kind of snake bit you, because there are different antivenoms. Exactly. You can go to the hospital. Sure.
[00:06:04.200] - Speaker 1
Yes, that's the most important thing. Yes.
[00:06:08.590] - Speaker 2
And thank you very much. That's all I have. No, miss. Thank you.
