And how old are you? 48. And what do you do for a living?
[00:00:09.140] - Speaker 1
Independent, selling food products.
[00:00:12.730] - Speaker 2
Are you married or a grandmother? Married. Do you have children? Yes. How long have you lived in El Carmen?
[00:00:21.980] - Speaker 1
Exactly, I had left for Bogotá and came back three years ago.
[00:00:26.570] - Speaker 2
Okay. So, do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:32.320] - Speaker 1
Yes, of course, yes, that's a possibility.
[00:00:34.160] - Speaker 2
Why?
[00:00:35.100] - Speaker 1
Because there are some, they pass by here in this area.
[00:00:37.950] - Speaker 2
Have any of your animals ever been bitten by a snake? No, not at this time. Do you know how to prevent or avoid a snake bite?
[00:00:51.340] - Speaker 1
First, don't have any contact with them, stay away if I see them or not.
[00:00:56.800] - Speaker 2
And what would you do if you saw a snake?
[00:01:01.350] - Speaker 1
It would scare me a lot.
[00:01:03.430] - Speaker 2
Sure. And would you trust the hospital in Carmen to treat a snake bite?
[00:01:14.770] - Speaker 1
No. Why? Because I don't think they have the specific antidote to control the venom of those snakes.
[00:01:22.390] - Speaker 2
Would you trust other hospitals, such as the nearby Carmen, to cure one?
[00:01:28.990] - Speaker 1
Yes, or turn everything upside down, or they say that in Tolemaida they also have the specific antidote to control snake venom.
[00:01:36.860] - Speaker 2
And where do you feel most likely to be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:01:45.220] - Speaker 1
In the countryside.
[00:01:46.500] - Speaker 2
Why?
[00:01:48.480] - Speaker 1
Because it always takes place outdoors, in open areas such as pastures and ravines.
[00:01:54.490] - Speaker 2
And do you know how to identify poisonous snakes or snakes that are venomous?
[00:02:02.140] - Speaker 1
No. For me, I think they're all poisonous.
[00:02:05.840] - Speaker 2
I don't know how to identify them. And do you know of any cases of snake bites?
[00:02:16.380] - Speaker 1
So, just among friends, right? Okay. Rumors you hear from people here who have been bitten by snakes in El Carmen.
[00:02:25.500] - Speaker 2
And if you need to go to the hospital, is it difficult? Is it difficult for you or is it easy?
[00:02:33.680] - Speaker 1
It's difficult because you always end up in the center of town because there's nowhere else to go.
[00:02:39.130] - Speaker 2
Well, I don't have any more questions, but do you have anything else to say about snakes or your knowledge of snakes?
[00:02:51.920] - Speaker 1
No, you have to be careful with the poisonous ones. Yes, of course. Avoid contact with them if you come across them.
[00:03:02.360] - Speaker 2
Yes. Well, it's important to know that you need to go to the hospital after a snake bite, because there are different antivenoms for different snakes. And yes, well, that's all I have. Thank you very much. You're welcome.
