For quite a few years now.
[00:00:24.110] - Speaker 1
Okay. So, do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:31.260] - Speaker 2
Of course not at the moment. Okay. Why? But I have seen them.
[00:00:37.250] - Speaker 1
Okay. Why not at that time?
[00:00:43.050] - Speaker 2
Because it has never bitten me. Okay.
[00:00:46.180] - Speaker 1
Okay. Have any of your animals ever been bitten by a snake? No. Okay. Do you know how to prevent or avoid a snake bite? No, I don't. What would you do if a snake bit you?
[00:01:07.210] - Speaker 2
Go to the hospital.
[00:01:09.690] - Speaker 1
Which hospital?
[00:01:10.260] - Speaker 2
From here to the town, Carmen de Oaxaca.
[00:01:15.060] - Speaker 1
And would you trust the hospital, in Carmen, here in Carmen? Would you trust the hospital, in Carmen, to cure a snake bite?
[00:01:19.500] - Speaker 2
No, I don't think so. Why? Because they always move you from one place to another, to another hospital.
[00:01:27.830] - Speaker 1
But you said you would go to the hospital in Carmen, but you don't trust the hospital in Carmen to treat a bite. Why would you go to the hospital in Carmen?
[00:01:43.880] - Speaker 2
Yes, I don't have any like that. No, no, no. So there haven't been many like that, who go to the hospital like that because of snake bites.
[00:01:55.420] - Speaker 1
And which other hospitals would you trust to treat a snake bite?
[00:02:05.170] - Speaker 2
Suddenly, through Irardó, El Espinal, Bogotá too.
[00:02:10.030] - Speaker 1
And where do you feel you are most likely to be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:02:20.530] - Speaker 2
Suddenly in the countryside.
[00:02:21.670] - Speaker 1
Why?
[00:02:22.060] - Speaker 2
From what one observes here in the countryside.
[00:02:27.550] - Speaker 1
And can you identify six poisonous and non-poisonous snakes?
[00:02:34.200] - Speaker 2
There are also poisonous ones. Some are poisonous and others are not.
[00:02:38.570] - Speaker 1
But you know how to identify different snakes. Yes. Okay. How do you identify different snakes?
[00:02:49.250] - Speaker 2
There are some called coral, which are red and black. And there are others that are black, which they say are the rotten ones. And do you know of any cases of snake bites?
[00:03:08.210] - Speaker 1
No. No? Okay. Well, if you need to go to the hospital, is that difficult for you or is it easy?
[00:03:15.720] - Speaker 2
It's always difficult when I have to carry a baby on foot to the village.
[00:03:20.310] - Speaker 1
Yes, okay. And, well, I don't have any more questions, but do you have anything else to say about snakes or your knowledge of snakes?
[00:03:31.070] - Speaker 2
No, that's not why.
[00:03:32.120] - Speaker 1
Well, the most important information is to go straight to the hospital after a snake bite. And it's important to know what kind of snake bit you, because there are different antivenoms for different snakes. You can take a picture of the snake or you can kill it and take it to the hospital. And yes. Well, thank you very much. That's all I have.
[00:04:03.850] - Speaker 2
Well, many.
