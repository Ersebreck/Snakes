[00:00:04.140] - Speaker 2
And how old are you?
[00:00:05.810] - Speaker 1
Forty years.
[00:00:07.330] - Speaker 2
And what do you do for a living?
[00:00:08.730] - Speaker 1
Here on the farm, I do various jobs, such as fence repair, cattle handling, cleaning paddocks, and many other tasks that come up.
[00:00:17.110] - Speaker 2
Are you married or single?
[00:00:20.450] - Speaker 1
No, I live in a common-law relationship with my wife.
[00:00:24.540] - Speaker 2
Do you have children?
[00:00:25.740] - Speaker 1
I have two.
[00:00:27.040] - Speaker 2
And how many years have you lived in El Carmen?
[00:00:30.050] - Speaker 1
Practically my whole life. Born and raised here in Carmen.
[00:00:35.020] - Speaker 2
So, do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:39.520] - Speaker 1
Yes, of course. Here we are, we are not immune to being bitten by a snake, because here you stay in the thicket, the thicket is the forest here, you never know, at any moment you go out to check on the cattle, do some work on the farm, and you never know, at any moment you could be bitten by an animal, a snake.
[00:00:59.430] - Speaker 2
Sure.
[00:01:00.450] - Speaker 1
Well, usually, when you get bitten by a snake, the first thing you do is rush to the hospital, because you don't know what to do in that moment. And then suddenly you I'm telling you this because it's happened to people I know, and they've told me that they panic, their heart rate goes up, and they say that the poison spreads faster in the blood. That's what I've heard, I don't know if it's true. But in general, whether that happens or not, the first thing you have to do is rush to the hospital and try to identify what kind of snake it is. The thing is, here, suddenly, at... Here, most of the time, you find the X size, but there are two kinds. One has a head that looks like a diamond, and the other is called cat hair. So, I don't know which one it is or if they're identified that way or what they really look like.
[00:02:20.320] - Speaker 1
Around here, you can find one that sometimes has coral, granadilla, and mitados, but you know they're not aggressive. I've stepped on them and they don't attack you. Yes, they get alarmed, but they don't attack you like a talla would. Although, for a snake to attack you, you'd have to step on it or get it in your face for it to get aggressive. The rest don't.
[00:02:57.700] - Speaker 2
I ask myself the questions. Has any of your animals ever been bitten by a snake?
[00:03:06.710] - Speaker 1
Yes, here about What can I say? That was at the beginning of last year. A snake killed one of our bull calves there in the lagoon, but we couldn't tell what kind of snake it was. We blamed it on a talla. It also killed us when we had goats here on the farm. It also killed us where there were two goats that were bitten by a snake. Because, usually, people here say it was a snake. Why? Because they took the animal and examined it. And here, on the neck of the young bull, we examined it with the pattern and looked closely to see what had happened to the animal, and we found a bite mark, about this size. The animal started foaming at the mouth and then, at about... That was around two in the afternoon. The other day it started bleeding from its eyes. So, my boss and I said, "No, Camilo, this was a snake bite, but we couldn't identify what kind of snake it was.
[00:04:19.567] - Speaker 1
" And the same thing happened with the goats. One afternoon they brought them here because they were sleeping in the pen that used to be there.
[00:04:33.330] - Speaker 1
And two arrived, the first one arrived, then the herd arrived, and a little later another one arrived. It arrived all sweaty, breathing very fast. And finally, I said, "Well, that must be because of the heat." And it started foaming at the mouth. I said, "That's strange." A little while later, I went to look, and it was lying on the floor. And it stayed there until about eight or nine at night. I went to look, and it was bleeding from both sides. So, it was also a snake bite. And he died. Yes, of course, he died. He was dead in the morning. Domingo, the young bull, that was around two, seven, eight in the evening, they were already dead. And they swell up like that. And they last a long time. That young bull lasted there swollen like that for, what can I say? Like three, four days. The pimps came, they didn't do anything to him, but after four or five days, they started to get worse and eat him.
[00:05:38.496] - Speaker 1
And the same thing happened to me. Of course, the goats, I buried them. I didn't leave them there, I buried them, because they were obviously smaller. That's all I can tell you about that.
[00:05:52.390] - Speaker 1
I don't know what you're going to ask me about that.
[00:05:56.800] - Speaker 2
Yes. And you know what? How can you prevent a snake bite?
[00:06:03.180] - Speaker 1
People usually say that you can prevent it by wearing rubber boots. Because here, when I go out right now, because I'm raking the lawn at home, I'm not wearing rubber boots, but whenever I go out I wear some boots I have, which are those ones there, which come up to about here. But usually, when I go down to the meadow, where there are more tangles, I wear rubber boots, which I think is one of the ways to prevent it, although many say that a snake can pass through rubber boots as if they weren't there. But here I use rubber boots. I also use some shin guards that my boss brought me, which cover this whole area here. I have them here, they look like a bite mark. Do you want me to answer? Because they were already counted. We won't be together, but everyone does their own route. The important thing is not to think about anything. These are the ones. I wear these either with rubber boots or with my work boots.
[00:07:12.788] - Speaker 1
Here, when I go down there to La Maraña. I have some new ones that are taller, they come up to here.
[00:07:20.820] - Speaker 1
Okay, yes. Hey, didn't you say hello? So, that's what I use here when I go out there. When I'm here near the house, I don't use them, and I always try to keep it clean here, at the foot of the house, because even here we were one night. I come here and put up a hammock and lie down here to watch TV. And that day I wasn't in the hammock, my son was there. I don't know why I looked down when there was a corala under the hammock, where he suddenly lowered his feet and stepped on it. I think they even bite you. Here, since we have chickens, instead of the chickens coming here, they stay over there by the ATV. And once a mitado came and killed two of my chicks under the chickens. And I also killed one about 15 or 20 days ago, a coral snake this long, right there in that part over there. And I spray here, instead of around the house, I spray with friolina, which helps scare them away because of the smell.
[00:08:33.713] - Speaker 1
That's how we prevent them here, right?
[00:08:36.910] - Speaker 1
We take preventive measures in the field to keep them away.
[00:08:40.680] - Speaker 2
And what would you do if a snake bit you? So what?
[00:08:45.590] - Speaker 1
Well, mother, I would do what I just told you. If a snake bites me, the only thing I do is Some people say that you should tie a knot above the bite so that the poison doesn't spread so quickly, but I don't know if that's true. Thank God it's never happened to me, but I say the first thing you do is head to the hospital, because what else can you do? At least I'm here alone, because my wife goes to work, my son goes to school, and I stay here doing farm work. So, the only thing I do is keep my cell phone handy, so if anything happens to me, I can immediately call my wife and she'll come and at least help me clean up. But the most important thing, I think, is to go to the hospital. There was a case where my uncle Pedro's wife, Mrs. Silvia, was bitten by a snake, but she was so scared. She was so scared that she walked from here to where I'm standing, like from here to Guanávara, and she fell down from the shock.
[00:09:57.130] - Speaker 1
So they took her to the hospital and asked her what kind of snake it was, so they could give her an antidote to counteract the snake's venom. But they couldn't give her anything because they didn't know what kind of snake it was. So what did they do? They went to look for it in the place where Oh, my God! To the place where the snake had bitten her, and she was there, the snake was there. It turns out that the woman had gone to cut some brooms to sweep the house, and in a small patch of grass, she stepped on it and the snake bit her. But the snake didn't go away, it stayed there. It was still there when we went to look for her, she was there, stuck in Chipana, in the same area, because they say there are more snakes there.
[00:10:54.820] - Speaker 2
And would you trust the hospital, in Carmen, to cure a love? And won't it help you to be faithful?
[00:11:00.840] - Speaker 1
No, here in the hospital, honestly, they let you die. Here in the hospital, there are no guarantees. Sure, it's a health center that can provide you with something, but that's hardly even first aid, because that's what you get. That's what you get, and for someone to treat you there, you have to arrive already, like in the story, with your guts hanging out, so they can say it's an emergency. So, we always, as a rule, head for Girardón. Here at the Carmen hospital, let me take it. Here at the Carmen hospital, no. Whenever something happens, and you're not exempt from waking up sick with some kind of illness, we always go to the hospital in Girardón.
[00:11:44.790] - Speaker 2
And would you trust other hospitals as well? Girardón or Espinal?
[00:11:54.730] - Speaker 1
We usually always go There's a very good service in Espinal, in Girardón. Me too. I don't know what the service is like in other places, but I can vouch for the hospital and clinic in Girardón and Espinal.
[00:12:12.680] - Speaker 2
Yes, okay. And where do you feel you're most likely to get bitten by a snake? Out in the country or at home?
[00:12:21.920] - Speaker 1
For me, the most likely place to be bitten by a snake is outside the house. Outside the house in what sense? Out there in the pastures. Because in the pastures, because in the pastures you go, at least around here, I go through that pasture, you never know when you might come across one of those snakes, because there's a lot of undergrowth. Whereas here, I think that because it's clean, they might come, but it's less likely that they'll come here than that you'll find them in the pasture.
[00:12:51.370] - Speaker 2
And do you know how to be self-effacing?
[00:12:53.390] - Speaker 1
I'll show you some photos I have here of some we killed. Let's see if I can find them.
[00:12:58.560] - Speaker 2
How about the size?
[00:13:00.430] - Speaker 1
Yes. And they were mating. Let's see if I can find them.
[00:13:09.950] - Speaker 2
There are many sizes here.
[00:13:11.940] - Speaker 1
No, it's the size. I don't know if I deleted them. He told me.
[00:13:37.820] - Speaker 2
Yes, kid, but I couldn't have burned it out of disgust.
[00:13:52.110] - Speaker 1
Look at them, don't push me. But it's disgusting, they're not bothering you.
[00:13:56.900] - Speaker 2
Yes.
[00:13:58.020] - Speaker 1
Those two. There, if you want, follow them, because I think there are other photos of that. It's big. Yes, of course. Those two were almost 1.50 meters each. And this size thick, look. We killed them by throwing them away, we were mowing them down. But the tangle got in the way here, see? We buried that and went over here, down to the knee.
[00:14:22.530] - Speaker 2
Yes, it's a size. And then
[00:14:29.420] - Speaker 1
Mirela, look at the thickness of the Can you see them here? Yes. Ambi, maid. You can see that the one next to it is there, but it's thicker. And they were wrapped around each other like this, you see. Like this, look. Half of the male was wrapped around the female, and his head was like this, barely visible, and he was moving his tail. I went from here to where the fan is, and I was there and they were there. I said, "What's moving over there? That's so weird." I turned off the wire and went closer, and sure enough, it was the two of them there. And then it was time to kill them. They say you shouldn't kill them, but here, at least, if I find a snake and it bites me, I kill it right away.
[00:15:17.950] - Speaker 2
So, can you identify all snakes now?
[00:15:21.490] - Speaker 1
That's why I'm telling you this, because you can identify them, because they are a certain size, according to what you, as a kid, were taught by your parents, that the size is marked with crossed X's, but here there are some with a different head, because I've killed some that have a completely round head, and there are others that have a head that is, as I would say, not quite round, but rather pointed and wide from the cheeks. The other one, on the other hand, is very round. That's how I killed them, I killed them here. Up there, in the Thank you. In the mountains. Once we killed one thicker than that guava tree, I think it was about that thick, about this size. That one was exactly two meters long. And that time, what can you say, there were three of us and I passed by, the other friend who was with me passed by and the second one who was there saw that something moved like this, he did this.
[00:16:29.590] - Speaker 1
So, dude, look, you guys walked right over it and it didn't do anything. And it was like this with its tail and head like this.
[00:16:39.190] - Speaker 1
And if it ever happened to us, it was: "Go ahead, let it bite you." One of those animals that bites you there. And even one of these that I showed you, if it bites you, I don't think you'd have more than an hour to live, because I think one of those animals injects you with a lot of venom.
[00:16:58.140] - Speaker 2
Yes, of course.
[00:16:59.320] - Speaker 1
So, one of us and I, when we go out here in the pastures, we wear rubber boots. And a machete, which is essential in the countryside. That's all I can tell you. I don't know what else I can say on this subject. And here is the friend who also lived in Dejo. That's the tree.
[00:17:23.660] - Speaker 2
That's scary. Well, I don't have any more questions. Do you have anything else to say about snakes or your knowledge of how to be a snake?
[00:17:35.310] - Speaker 1
Yes, it would be good if they told you what to do in that moment. Suddenly something happens, like when you get bitten by a snake and you immediately become alarmed and scared. You just get scared and your heart rate goes up, your heart is And I understand, and my boss is a doctor, and she says that when your heart beats faster, that's when it starts pumping blood faster. Then all the blood in your body starts flowing faster. So, I say, imagine you're bitten by a snake and you're scared, because the poison spreads faster through your body. So, it would be good to have a theory of what to do in that moment, in case you get bitten by a snake, something that can calm you down while you go to a medical center.
[00:18:38.010] - Speaker 2
After a snake bite, it's important to stay calm, because yes, your blood can run faster if you panic. And it's important to go straight to the hospital after a bite. And it's important to know what kind of snake bit you, because there are different antivenoms for different snakes. Yes, ma'am. And you can take a picture or kill it and take it to the hospital. And tourniquets are not recommended either, because the blood needs to flow through your body. If you use a tourniquet, you may lose a leg or an arm. That's the most important information. But I think you know a lot about snakes and how to prevent bites. But yes, thank you very much.
[00:19:52.130] - Speaker 1
On a scale of one to ten, how much?
[00:19:54.020] - Speaker 2
Yes.
[00:19:55.460] - Speaker 1
The rating.
[00:19:58.650] - Speaker 2
I see.
[00:20:01.410] - Speaker 1
No, sometimes when I'm here cutting, I cut them with the knife. Thank you. Down there, where my older brother lives, yes, there are a lot of rattlesnakes.
[00:20:12.820] - Speaker 2
Yes, that too.
[00:20:14.920] - Speaker 1
There, sometimes I go because he tells me to go and help him gather them, and there and there, instead of picking them up, he throws them around. Once I chopped one as thick as this and it was as long as from here to the helmet, and I split it a little, like a quarter of the way down from the head. And do you think, Tulio, that that animal came and turned around and bit itself with the piece that was left? She turned around and bit herself with the piece that was left. So, it was the aggression of that animal that There are also very loud rattles there. And here, especially in this area, they find a lot of big ones. These are as big as a ram. And that other one is found a lot in that coral.
[00:21:06.810] - Speaker 2
Yes, coral too.
[00:21:09.770] - Speaker 1
Yes, that's what I think.
[00:21:11.790] - Speaker 2
Yes, but your house is very clean.
[00:21:16.380] - Speaker 1
Yes, what you can see around the house. I keep it very clean, for the same reason, because of the snakes.
[00:21:22.410] - Speaker 2
Yes, exactly. It's good, yes.
[00:21:24.250] - Speaker 1
And the other thing is that chickens, when they see a snake, that's another clean-up job. Chickens see a snake and they immediately attack it, man, they peck at it, they do whatever they can, until it freezes.
[00:21:39.560] - Speaker 2
Yes. Well, thank you very much.
[00:21:44.340] - Speaker 1
Well, yes, ma'am. With pleasure.
