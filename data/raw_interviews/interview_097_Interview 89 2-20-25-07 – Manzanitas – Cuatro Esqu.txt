Sixty-seven.
[00:00:09.480] - Speaker 2
And what do you do for a living?
[00:00:11.380] - Speaker 1
In the countryside. I don't live in the countryside. I'm in town because my wife is in Valores, but I live in the countryside, I live in Veracua. I have some livestock, I have a farm in Asenso. It's called the agriculture page. I'm a farmer, it's going to give me everything. Okay. I grow food.
[00:00:26.500] - Speaker 2
Are you married or single?
[00:00:28.500] - Speaker 1
Married.
[00:00:29.520] - Speaker 2
Do you have children?
[00:00:31.450] - Speaker 1
Yes, ma'am. I have three children.
[00:00:33.270] - Speaker 2
And how many years have you lived in Carmen?
[00:00:36.510] - Speaker 1
About 20 years ago. More than 20 years. More.
[00:00:41.870] - Speaker 2
More?
[00:00:42.640] - Speaker 1
But yes, like 20 years.
[00:00:45.870] - Speaker 2
So, do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:50.540] - Speaker 1
Of course, because you don't get dressed up when you live in the countryside, where I spend my time hunting, going into places where there are snakes, and then one day So you think, "No, but God and the Virgin Mary will look after me." I have made my food for my God, who rules over everything.
[00:01:06.980] - Speaker 2
Has any of your animals ever been bitten by a snake?
[00:01:10.650] - Speaker 1
No, once a green bug bit me, and they took me to the hospital because she was getting married soon And no, it didn't do anything to me, and it was like, "No, that was the green one, not this one." It managed to grab me, but I shook it off. Just a little, but I didn't because it's not dangerous. It just scratched me. And do you know how to prevent or avoid a snake bite?
[00:01:34.500] - Speaker 2
And what would you do if a snake bit you?
[00:01:39.020] - Speaker 1
Well, find the doctor, the lightest one, take him to a light one, that's what you think. So that only one person sees him, not to scare anyone would be the first thing. And run out quickly wherever you find him, whoever picks him up.
[00:01:53.340] - Speaker 2
And which doctor would you go to, which hospital?
[00:01:58.480] - Speaker 1
To the hospital, I remember the closest hospital, which is Carmen de Apicala.
[00:02:03.520] - Speaker 2
And would you trust the hospital in Carmen to cure a bite?
[00:02:07.230] - Speaker 1
Well, someone has to be the first to go so they can send someone else, because there's no antidote there. I think it's at the Gar and the Torremaida base.
[00:02:17.350] - Speaker 2
And would you trust other hospitals to treat a snake bite?
[00:02:23.430] - Speaker 1
Yes, I think they took him to a good hospital, of course.
[00:02:27.760] - Speaker 2
And where do you feel more likely to be bitten by a snake, in the countryside or at home?
[00:02:33.540] - Speaker 1
No, it can be placed anywhere. It doesn't have to be in the house; it can be in the field. Yes, of course. Some people have bitten it more often at home than in the field. How many years? How many years? How many years?
[00:02:43.180] - Speaker 2
And do you know how to identify poisonous snakes or snakes that are venomous?
[00:02:50.210] - Speaker 1
Yes, more or less, I don't understand.
[00:02:52.310] - Speaker 2
And how do you identify different snakes?
[00:02:56.480] - Speaker 1
Because here is the carving, the bell. The bell isn't necessary, but it's mainly the carving or the X.
[00:03:03.310] - Speaker 2
And how do you identify snakes? By their color or something else? Their skin?
[00:03:14.450] - Speaker 1
By a color, the colors. One knows what kind of snake it is: a carving, an X, a hunter.
[00:03:23.950] - Speaker 2
And do you know of a case of a snake with brown fur?
[00:03:28.430] - Speaker 1
No, several children have been bitten on the farm, mostly children, picking leaves, there's water in the fields, several children have always been bitten. Yes, children have been bitten by snakes there.
[00:03:42.010] - Speaker 2
And if you need to go to the hospital, is that difficult for you or easy?
[00:03:49.870] - Speaker 1
It depends, it's not an issue, because in the countryside it's difficult, because transportation is terrible.
[00:03:53.120] - Speaker 2
Yes, of course.
[00:03:55.540] - Speaker 1
But we looked for one there.
[00:03:57.340] - Speaker 2
I have no further questions, but do you have anything else to say about snakes or your knowledge of snakes?
[00:04:05.460] - Speaker 1
No, it doesn't suit me
[00:04:06.970] - Speaker 2
And it's important to know that you need to go straight to the hospital after a snake bite. Of course. And it's important to know what kind of snake bit you, because there are different antivenoms for different snakes, and you can take a picture of the snake or you can kill it and take it to the hospital.
[00:04:30.370] - Speaker 1
Yes, that's what I've been told.
[00:04:32.400] - Speaker 2
Well, that's all I have. Thank you very much.
[00:04:36.420] - Speaker 1
No, thank you very much. Thank you.
