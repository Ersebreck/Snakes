[00:00:27.050] - Speaker 1
All my life, because I stayed here in the neighborhood. We live here.
[00:00:31.270] - Speaker 2
So, do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:35.510] - Speaker 1
No, I don't think so. Why? No, because I've found lots of them and I always make the kit and kill them.
[00:00:44.010] - Speaker 2
Have any of your animals ever been bitten by a snake? No. Do you know how to prevent or avoid a snake bite?
[00:00:58.300] - Speaker 1
Well, I say you should watch it for a while and make sure the snake doesn't bite you, because then you can kill it or do whatever you want and not let it bite you. But if you step on it and don't see it, like what happened to my sister, who was walking with her dogs, two little dogs she had, the kind that are small, a tiny breed, and they crossed in front of her. So, the snake was in the shade of a log, like a stick. And of course, she got scared when the dogs passed by, and then she passed by and it bit her. If you see them, of course, I've killed several and I run away from snakes.
[00:01:32.790] - Speaker 2
And what would you do if a snake bit you?
[00:01:38.310] - Speaker 1
What if it bit me? Well, if it bit me and I had to, why not? I was told to tie a green branch to it, pressing down hard on the foot so that the poison doesn't spread. And then go to the hospital in Girardo, because here in Carmen it's useless. My sister was there and they didn't do anything for her It's useless, to be honest.
[00:02:02.990] - Speaker 2
And is your sister Silvia or not? Silvia. Okay. And where do you feel most likely to get bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:02:15.860] - Speaker 1
Should one bite oneself?
[00:02:16.970] - Speaker 2
Yes. Where do you feel most likely to be bitten by a snake? In the countryside, at home?
[00:02:23.800] - Speaker 1
That's right, or should I say, that's what I would say? You can find them anywhere, right? Yes, of course. Yes, because you find them on the road, you find them on one side, then on the other.
[00:02:35.460] - Speaker 2
Yes, of course. Yes. And do you know how to identify poisonous and non-poisonous snakes? Yes. Okay. How do you identify snakes?
[00:02:47.590] - Speaker 1
Here are the ones that say Hello, how are you? Hello. There's one that's green, they say it's the bejuca snake, right? It's the green one. There's the talla, the candela, the raduja, the raduja. Yes.
[00:03:00.710] - Speaker 2
And how do you identify snakes? By their color, by their skin? By their color, the shape of the snake. And more than just the color?
[00:03:13.780] - Speaker 1
The color, more than anything else. Yes, because you know which ones are rotten, which ones are the right size, which ones are half ripe, which ones are ripe, and which ones are the other ones. There's another one too, what's it called? The ones that grow like this among the bushes, the thin ones. What's that weed called? La zapa, I don't know what you call it in the countryside. Hierrera, I can't remember what it's called.
[00:03:39.440] - Speaker 2
And you know of a case of a snake bite on your sister? On my sister. And did the bite happen in the countryside or at home? No.
[00:03:55.020] - Speaker 1
They sent her to the hospital, and she went to the village, they took her there. That day there was a brigade here at the school, and she was going to work and had to cross a pasture. The snake was in that pasture, and it bit her when she passed by. So she came running from there because it had rained a lot and there was a lot of mud. And then she came running, washed her feet, and then the people who were here at the school hospital threw her out because they took her to the car to go to the hospital. And they kept her there that day until three in the afternoon, and then we took her out of the hospital and brought her to Girardón.
[00:04:28.810] - Speaker 2
Did he come by at three in the afternoon, the bite?
[00:04:33.640] - Speaker 1
No, it didn't happen to her. I don't know why I didn't go with her. But they put her on an IV right away and gave her an injection and I don't know what else. I didn't realize what was happening. I went to see her and she was almost dead.
[00:04:44.040] - Speaker 2
That's too bad. And I forgot. Yes, okay. Was it a joke or was it... What would it be?
[00:05:01.470] - Speaker 1
No one knows, but I think it was a rotten piece of wood.
[00:05:05.020] - Speaker 2
And if you need to go to the hospital, is it easy for you or difficult?
[00:05:14.450] - Speaker 1
Let's go. No, the hospital here isn't for that. It's useless.
[00:05:17.990] - Speaker 2
But you have transportation and
[00:05:22.330] - Speaker 1
No, but you have to call a car, a motorcycle taxi, someone to take you on a motorcycle, whatever.
[00:05:26.010] - Speaker 2
It's easy to get there. Well, I don't have any more questions. But do you have anything else to say about snakes or your knowledge, your experiences, anything else?
[00:05:36.690] - Speaker 1
Yes, I've had experiences with snakes because I stood almost on top of them and saw them in time when they brought out their The thing is, they have... If it's long and it's going to strike at you, then it coils up quickly. That's when it strikes and bites you. I've had two cases like that with snakes. If you see them in time, you can kill them. I kill the small ones, but not the big ones because I'm afraid.
[00:06:02.200] - Speaker 2
Sure, me too. And yes, it's important for snake bites to go straight to the hospital after a bite, and it's important to know what kind of snake bit you.
[00:06:17.610] - Speaker 1
Yes, because the snake has to be taken to Girardón. So that they can see what kind of snake it was, examine it, look at it, because
[00:06:29.150] - Speaker 2
Well, that's all I have. Thank you very much for your time. Yes, ma'am. You're very kind. Okay.
