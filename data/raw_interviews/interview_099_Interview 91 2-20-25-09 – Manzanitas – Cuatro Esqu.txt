And how old are you? 26. And what do you do for a living?
[00:00:08.320] - Speaker 1
Right now I'm not working, I'm just studying to become a doctor.
[00:00:11.340] - Speaker 2
Are you married or single?
[00:00:14.680] - Speaker 1
Single.
[00:00:15.970] - Speaker 2
Do you have children?
[00:00:17.860] - Speaker 1
No.
[00:00:18.900] - Speaker 2
And how many years have you lived in El Carmen?
[00:00:21.800] - Speaker 1
All my life. Okay.
[00:00:24.400] - Speaker 2
So you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:28.110] - Speaker 1
Yes, of course. Imagine it in this season. Because there is a lot of vegetation, there are a lot of trees. It is during the rainy season that the animals come out the most.
[00:00:39.080] - Speaker 2
Has any of your animals ever been bitten by a snake? No. Any photos? No. Do you know how to prevent or avoid a snake bite? No. What would you do if you were bitten by a snake?
[00:00:54.500] - Speaker 1
No, let's get going to the doctor.
[00:00:58.450] - Speaker 2
And would you trust the hospital in Carmen to treat a snake bite? No, not here. Why not?
[00:01:06.480] - Speaker 1
I don't think the hospital provides good service.
[00:01:09.880] - Speaker 2
And where would you go if you were bitten by a snake? To Girardó, most likely. So, would you trust other hospitals to heal a dead person? Yes. Girardó and others too?
[00:01:23.460] - Speaker 1
Soon, in the end, yes, so close, it would be those two.
[00:01:27.660] - Speaker 2
And where do you feel it is? And are you more likely to be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:01:34.720] - Speaker 1
Here.
[00:01:35.710] - Speaker 2
Why?
[00:01:38.680] - Speaker 1
Sometimes my grandmother lives here. Sometimes you go out into that dark area and we've found snakes there several times. They've even tried to get in here, but I have two cats, so they scare them away. I've killed snakes here too.
[00:01:56.040] - Speaker 2
And do you know how to identify poisonous snakes from non-poisonous ones?
[00:02:02.600] - Speaker 1
They are poisonous, but not very effective.
[00:02:04.260] - Speaker 2
How do you identify snakes, if you can?
[00:02:10.160] - Speaker 1
Well, some are red and black, I don't know their names, but you say: "That snake is poisonous," or there are other types that you say: "Those are poisonous."
[00:02:20.300] - Speaker 2
Okay, yes.
[00:02:21.470] - Speaker 1
Yes, it's because of the color.
[00:02:26.050] - Speaker 2
Do you know of any cases of snake bites?
[00:02:33.360] - Speaker 1
But not here. A long time ago at school, a teacher, a snake, one of those red ones, bit him on the finger and they almost had to amputate his finger. And here in the village, by the sea, a woman I know. He works on a farm and a snake bit him on the leg and it's a problem. But that's about it, nothing else.
[00:02:57.340] - Speaker 2
And if you need to go to the hospital, is that difficult for you or easy?
[00:03:01.790] - Speaker 1
No, it's easy. I have a motorcycle. I don't have it there, but I do have a motorcycle.
[00:03:04.910] - Speaker 2
I don't have any more questions, but do you have anything else to say about snakes or your knowledge of snakes or anything like that?
[00:03:14.340] - Speaker 1
No, not really. I do kill them. I do. The truth is, when I do, I kill both of them, because you never know.
[00:03:21.080] - Speaker 2
And yes, it is important to go straight to the hospital after a snake bite, and it is important to know what kind of snake bit you. You can take a picture of the snake or you can kill it and take it to the hospital.
[00:03:40.380] - Speaker 1
With that, they extract the antidote, right?
[00:03:43.360] - Speaker 2
Yes, because there are different antivenoms for different snakes.
[00:03:48.990] - Speaker 1
Yes, I had heard that, that when a snake bites you, it's good, it kills, well, take it.
[00:03:54.380] - Speaker 2
Exactly, yes. That's what it's for.
[00:03:56.450] - Speaker 1
It was the only thing that had been arrested.
[00:03:58.370] - Speaker 2
I don't know anything else. Yes, no problem. Thank you very much, that's all I have.
