[00:00:38.930] - Speaker 2
All my life, born and raised here. Okay, fine.
[00:00:42.620] - Speaker 1
So, do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:46.990] - Speaker 2
Yes, of course, because there's always plenty of ass around here.
[00:00:49.550] - Speaker 1
Have any of your animals ever been bitten by a snake? No. Do you know how to prevent or avoid a snake bite?
[00:01:02.100] - Speaker 2
No, not really. Because when someone gets annoyed, those who have been annoyed, don't go and tell them what they said: Salén, turn around twice for the clinic, give him that. But here you can't, I mean, you don't know anything.
[00:01:14.070] - Speaker 1
And before a snake bite, do you know how to avoid snakes and snake bites?
[00:01:22.350] - Speaker 2
So, so they don't hurt you? Yeah. No, not really. No, because it's already leaving, but when it's also angry or a lot of times you don't see it and it steps on you.
[00:01:30.820] - Speaker 1
And what would you do if a snake bit you?
[00:01:37.340] - Speaker 2
Send him to the hospital. Isn't that the same thing? If he doesn't have one left, then he doesn't have another one.
[00:01:41.850] - Speaker 1
And which hospital?
[00:01:43.900] - Speaker 2
If it's your turn here, no, you have to go to Girardot, because here the Carmen hospital doesn't And it's not like there's anyone in Girardot who does it the old way, no. Yes, there is in Girardot, I think there is in Girardot.
[00:01:55.180] - Speaker 1
Wouldn't you trust the hospital, in Carmen, to cure someone dying like that?
[00:01:59.030] - Speaker 2
No, why would you? Because there isn't anything there I mean, there's nothing there, it's basically a health center for first aid, but that's it, I don't see anything else. It's better not to waste time and go straight to where the doctor is.
[00:02:14.790] - Speaker 1
And where do you feel you are most likely to be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:02:21.500] - Speaker 2
Well, yes, equally, because sometimes you get up at night or you're around here and when there's a snake, you see it slithering around. And also, when it's about to rain, they look for dry places. And in the pastures, in the fields, outside the house, it's the same thing, because in the pasture there's already mud or it's passing through. Yes, it's the same.
[00:02:42.830] - Speaker 1
And can you identify six snakes that are poisonous or non-poisonous?
[00:02:48.780] - Speaker 2
No, the only thing I can identify is the size, X. The rest, I Because they tell me that there's at least one coral snake that's deadly, or I catch one, she sees it and says, "No, that snake isn't poisonous," but I tell myself that they all are. But the size is the most common one you see, the one you're most afraid of.
[00:03:08.250] - Speaker 1
And do you know of any cases of snake bites?
[00:03:16.060] - Speaker 2
Well, I heard when she bit the lady here, the one from Novena María, that I heard she had been bitten by a snake and that she waited too long to go to the doctor and died. That was the only thing, nothing else. I haven't heard much.
[00:03:31.080] - Speaker 1
And if you need to go to the hospital, is that difficult for you or easy?
[00:03:36.230] - Speaker 2
No, it always gets complicated because of comparisons. At seven in the evening, if I don't get a good spot, and one of those animals bites you, you're done for. As for Gerardo del Carmen, there's no transportation for Gerardó until the next one, at five in the morning, so you'd have to get him there yourself, and that costs a little money. 150 or 100,000 dollars for a life. That's what it would cost you.
[00:04:02.680] - Speaker 1
Well, I don't have any more questions, but do you have anything else to say about snakes or your knowledge of snakes?
[00:04:10.260] - Speaker 2
No, because the truth is, I tell him: Lick the snake, whether it's poisonous or not. To me, they're snakes, I'm afraid of the barracco, I tell him I drank it. I'm afraid of the barracco, I'm not afraid of you.
[00:04:23.330] - Speaker 1
And yes, for snake bites it is important to know what to do and go to the hospital after a bite. It is also important to know what kind of snake bit you, because there are different snakes and different antivenoms for different snakes.
[00:04:42.990] - Speaker 2
Yes, I've heard that too, that it's one to one I mean, people say to you: Hey, when one bites you, I mean, I don't want it, a snake bites you. First look what kind of snake it is, because they don't give you any antidote, they don't even tell you what kind of snake it is, not that it bit me, but you don't know what kind of snake it is.
[00:05:01.230] - Speaker 1
Yes, and you can take a photo of the snake or you can put it in and take it with you.
[00:05:05.400] - Speaker 2
Yes, for one person, yes, that's how it goes. Yes, the easiest part falls to one person. But thank you, I don't have any more.
[00:05:11.070] - Speaker 1
Well, don't thank you. Thank you very much for your time. No, no, thank you.
