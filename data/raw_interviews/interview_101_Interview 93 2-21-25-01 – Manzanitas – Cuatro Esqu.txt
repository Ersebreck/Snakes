All my life.
[00:00:25.790] - Speaker 1
So, do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:31.040] - Speaker 2
Yes, there is some risk.
[00:00:34.390] - Speaker 1
Why?
[00:00:34.800] - Speaker 2
Because it's a rural area, we're kind of in their habitat.
[00:00:42.160] - Speaker 1
Have any of your animals ever been bitten by a snake? No, ma'am. And do you know how to prevent or avoid a snake bite?
[00:00:52.180] - Speaker 2
Well, not very well, but the basics.
[00:00:58.190] - Speaker 1
And what methods? And during the day, in the morning?
[00:01:00.060] - Speaker 2
Well, generally speaking, when traveling on roads, you need to use a flashlight or something to see where you're going. The roads are usually dark at night. And during the day, you have to be careful in areas where you think there might be snakes, say, at the edge of ravines during the winter. They usually seek out dry areas. So, avoid that when you're going to move, say, some objects that are piled up, be careful when moving them and so on.
[00:01:30.780] - Speaker 1
Sure. And what would you do if a snake bit you?
[00:01:36.940] - Speaker 2
First of all, you have to catch the snake to find out what kind of snake bit you, or rather, you have to kill it. Then, you need to go to the hospital as soon as possible.
[00:01:49.390] - Speaker 1
Yes. And which hospital would you go to?
[00:01:52.930] - Speaker 2
First, it would be here in Carmen, because it's the closest area.
[00:01:59.240] - Speaker 1
And would you trust the hospital in Carmen to treat a snake bite? No, not really. Why not?
[00:02:06.610] - Speaker 2
Because it's a low-level hospital. I don't think they have Well, I think they do have some anti-physiological serums, but I'm not sure. Last I heard, they did, but right now I don't know if they have them.
[00:02:19.440] - Speaker 1
Would you trust other hospitals to treat a snake bite?
[00:02:24.150] - Speaker 2
Well, generally speaking, if it was suddenly a snake, and you really see that it is dangerous and your life is in danger, the best thing to do would be to go to Tolemaida, because that is where they have the most antivenom serums.
[00:02:38.870] - Speaker 1
And if you need to go to the hospital, is that difficult for you or easy?
[00:02:43.700] - Speaker 2
We have motorcycle transport.
[00:02:47.530] - Speaker 1
And where do you feel most likely to be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:02:54.300] - Speaker 2
In the countryside.
[00:02:55.280] - Speaker 1
Why?
[00:02:56.590] - Speaker 2
Because it's their neighborhood, and you're kind of invading their neighborhood.
[00:03:01.980] - Speaker 1
Can you identify six poisonous and non-poisonous snakes?
[00:03:05.770] - Speaker 2
Yes, I am somewhat familiar with poisonous snakes.
[00:03:11.960] - Speaker 1
And how do you identify different snakes?
[00:03:14.670] - Speaker 2
Let's say the poisonous ones, which are really the ones you see around here, which are the talla, the coral, and the pudridora, which are the most common in this area.
[00:03:27.210] - Speaker 1
And do you identify snakes by their color or skin?
[00:03:31.460] - Speaker 2
Because of their color and the shape of their heads. Mainly because of the colors and features they show in their cameras.
[00:03:41.060] - Speaker 1
And wasn't there a big deal made about a snake bite?
[00:03:47.740] - Speaker 2
Yes, here in Ovillo. That girl, a woman, I think she died. And here too, Javier, another guy in the village, was also bitten, but thank God they managed to save him. It took a long time, but the girl is recovering again.
[00:04:10.800] - Speaker 1
I don't have any more questions, but do you have anything else to say about snakes or your knowledge of snakes? Anything else?
[00:04:19.390] - Speaker 2
No, because around here there are a lot of them, and everyone confuses them with other species because they have certain similar characteristics when they are a certain size. And many people kill them thinking they are poisonous, when in fact they are not. I even think that the poisonous snakes eat the others. The rest are not poisonous.
[00:04:42.280] - Speaker 1
Okay, yes. Well, yes, it's important after a snake bite to go straight to the hospital. And you know, it's important to know what kind of snake bit you. You can take a picture, put it in a bag, and take it to the hospital.
[00:04:59.290] - Speaker 2
Yes, it's the most important thing, because when you don't know that you've been bitten, you arrive at the hospital and they don't know how to proceed. They can't give you just any serum because it could cause normal labor. Yes.
[00:05:13.460] - Speaker 1
Thank you very much for your time.
