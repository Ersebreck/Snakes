[00:00:25.320] - Speaker 1
And how many years have you lived in Carmen?
[00:00:27.990] - Speaker 2
I've been in El Carmen for about 11 years now.
[00:00:30.440] - Speaker 1
Okay. So, do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:37.640] - Speaker 2
I do. Why? Yes, because in the parts where I've been there have been loads of them.
[00:00:43.570] - Speaker 1
Yes, of course.
[00:00:45.370] - Speaker 2
Not here at the moment. We've been here a month, but no. I haven't seen the first one. Okay.
[00:00:52.110] - Speaker 1
And have any of your animals ever been bitten by a snake?
[00:00:55.730] - Speaker 2
No, ma'am.
[00:00:56.880] - Speaker 1
Thank God not. You know how? And aren't you afraid of avoiding a snake bite? No. What would you do if a snake bit you? It can't bite me.
[00:01:10.940] - Speaker 2
No idea, because I don't know how to handle that situation.
[00:01:20.990] - Speaker 1
Would you trust the hospital in Carmen to treat a snake bite? No. Okay. Why not?
[00:01:31.870] - Speaker 2
No, because at the moment I don't think there is the capacity to deal with the death of the snake.
[00:01:42.250] - Speaker 1
And would you trust other hospitals to treat a snake bite?
[00:01:48.260] - Speaker 2
It depends, maybe two will turn. Okay.
[00:01:54.370] - Speaker 1
And where do you feel most likely to be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:02:02.310] - Speaker 2
To work in the mountains, because that's the most livable place there, that's where it is.
[00:02:08.490] - Speaker 1
And do you know how to identify poisonous snakes from non-poisonous ones?
[00:02:15.950] - Speaker 2
No, hardly.
[00:02:18.820] - Speaker 1
And do you know of any cases of snake bites? No. And if you need to go to the hospital, is it difficult for you or easy?
[00:02:31.000] - Speaker 2
Well, it depends. Wherever your husband is, you take him. But if you're alone, you go.
[00:02:39.460] - Speaker 1
Well, I don't have any more questions, but do you have anything else to say about snakes or your knowledge of snakes or anything else? No, not really. And the most important thing to remember is that after a snake bite, you should go straight to the hospital. And it's important to know what kind of snake bit you, because there are different snakes and different antivenoms for different snakes. So, you can take a picture of the snake or you can kill it and take it to the hospital. And yes, I don't have anything else, but thank you very much for your time.
