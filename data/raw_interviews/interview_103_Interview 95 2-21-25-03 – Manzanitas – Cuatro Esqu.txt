And what's your name?
[00:00:01.440] - Speaker 1
María Rose García Valdeján.
[00:00:03.180] - Speaker 2
And do you agree to the interview and recording?
[00:00:06.760] - Speaker 1
Yes, I'll go in and see, because I'll learn something there.
[00:00:10.980] - Speaker 2
And how old are you?
[00:00:13.310] - Speaker 1
70.
[00:00:14.490] - Speaker 2
And what do you do for a living? If you work, that is.
[00:00:16.980] - Speaker 1
Well, right now I'm not working because I'm here with my daughter, but most of the time I live in the village. And my children feed me because I'm a widow.
[00:00:27.750] - Speaker 2
Are you married? No, I'm a widow. Do you have children? Three. How long have you lived in El Carmen?
[00:00:38.430] - Speaker 1
47 years old. Okay.
[00:00:41.850] - Speaker 2
So, do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake? Of course you will.
[00:00:46.000] - Speaker 1
If you don't know, you could get bitten by a snake at any time, day or night. Well, at any moment one of those animals could come out and scare you, and then it could bite you. If you're not quick, as they say, to defend yourself, if you don't see it in time, then yes, it will bite you.
[00:01:01.250] - Speaker 2
Has any of your animals ever been bitten by a snake?
[00:01:07.130] - Speaker 1
No, not in my family, thank God.
[00:01:10.410] - Speaker 2
Of your animals, have any of them been bitten?
[00:01:15.060] - Speaker 1
Animals? No, not really. No, ma'am. Not at this time of year, no animals.
[00:01:20.550] - Speaker 2
And do you know how to prevent or avoid a snake bite?
[00:01:26.440] - Speaker 1
Well, as far as avoiding it, yes, no. But when the snake bites a person or animal, if you are there at the time, there are many ways to deal with it. For example, you can pray to the snake not to bite, you can make a tourniquet, and if you have very good teeth, you can extract the venom from the person who has been bitten, and so on.
[00:01:52.290] - Speaker 2
And what would you do if a morevula bit you?
[00:01:56.140] - Speaker 1
May God protect me and help me. At a time like that, suddenly The closest place would be the living room.
[00:02:02.650] - Speaker 2
And which hospital would you go to?
[00:02:07.930] - Speaker 1
Well, yes, if the hospital was nearby, yes.
[00:02:09.930] - Speaker 2
In El Carmen?
[00:02:11.600] - Speaker 1
Suddenly, Carmen. Yes, the closest hospital is ours, the one in Carmen, because that's where they have the anti-hijacking serum, and if they don't have it, they send for it, they look for it wherever it is.
[00:02:21.720] - Speaker 2
And would you trust the hospital, in Carmen, to cure a more severe snake bite?
[00:02:27.310] - Speaker 1
Well, not 100%, because after all, it will reach people, and suddenly there won't be any anti-Hujido serum available, so it's better to transfer them immediately, either to the Tolemaira base or to the Ibaquén hospital, where they have all the anti-Hujido serum needed to treat someone as quickly as possible.
[00:02:51.990] - Speaker 2
And if you need to go to the hospital, is that difficult for you or easy?
[00:02:57.610] - Speaker 1
Well, from here to there, as long as there's good transportation at home or at a neighbor's, they get you out. And where do you feel most likely to get bitten by a snake?
[00:03:08.180] - Speaker 2
At home or in the country?
[00:03:13.150] - Speaker 1
Well, Mercé, the truth is, anywhere, because when you go out, if you're at home and there's a yard and they're in a bad way, they'll bite you to death. And if you're at home with lots of stuff around and one suddenly slips under the door, you don't even notice.
[00:03:25.880] - Speaker 2
Sure, yes.
[00:03:27.380] - Speaker 1
That's right, that's how it is, as long as you have You can't get away from the fact that you don't kill an animal, just as you can walk through the mountains, through there, and no animal bothers you because you don't come across them.
[00:03:43.940] - Speaker 2
And do you know how to identify poisonous snakes from non-poisonous ones?
[00:03:48.370] - Speaker 1
Well, just a few. For example, the one they call bejuca isn't poisonous. The green one. That one isn't poisonous. The ones I'm afraid of and respect are the talla and the coral rabo de ají. Those are terrible.
[00:04:07.760] - Speaker 3
And to the rotter.
[00:04:08.950] - Speaker 1
Well, yes, the rotting one does. Because she practically bites and lets the flesh rot away. And the other one kills because it kills you, because the poison is so fast that if you don't get treatment quickly, it kills you, whether you're an animal or a person. And so on.
[00:04:32.540] - Speaker 2
And how do you identify different snakes? By their colors. Colors, okay. And do you know of any cases of snake bites?
[00:04:44.300] - Speaker 1
But that was a long time ago. A long time ago, on a farm that my husband owned, a boy who was working there was bitten by a snake. But thank God, they treated him there and he recovered.
[00:04:57.590] - Speaker 3
Do you pray it?
[00:04:58.320] - Speaker 1
Yes, they prayed for him and he was healed.
[00:05:00.430] - Speaker 2
Wasn't the snake poisonous? Yes, poisonous, totally poisonous. And he went to the hospital and received treatment?
[00:05:06.090] - Speaker 1
No, he didn't go to the hospital. Marcelina treated him at home. There are parts of the body that doctors know the prayers to recite for. So that's all you need, faith is all that's missing. And the herbs that arrive at that moment to draw out the poison, extract the poison from the wound. That's all I know, really. Okay.
[00:05:30.200] - Speaker 2
Okay. And yes, I don't have any more questions, but do you have anything else to say about snakes or your knowledge of snakes or anything else? No. No?
[00:05:41.360] - Speaker 1
No, for example, in the one they call tocha, if you don't imitate her, you're useless. The truth is, one woman walks, stops, and the others walk in line behind her.
[00:05:50.390] - Speaker 3
Yes, one chased me a lot one day.
[00:05:52.360] - Speaker 1
That snake, the truth is that it chases you when you're breastfeeding your baby, it chases you. If you take the road and find it there or tie it up so that it can drink the milk that comes out of your breast, it follows you, follows you, follows you, until they say that it hits you and makes you dizzy and drinks the milk. That's what they told me back there, where my wife and I lived for so long.
[00:06:17.470] - Speaker 3
My little daughter was there when
[00:06:18.660] - Speaker 1
And she stands in line. But the thing is She stands right there in line and walks like this, because I saw her walking, chasing him, chasing him. Until...
[00:06:28.580] - Speaker 3
But I don't know, it chased me, sorry. It chased me because I lived upstairs with my in-laws. I already had a small baby. And every day I would go to bring my husband lunch to where Don José la Lindy lived. And since it was a narrow passageway with a cliff and a ravine, the snake would come and hide in the shade underneath. There was a palm tree and the bush to keep warm. And I always spent the afternoon there with the snake, but now it's really big. It has big yellow spots and big eyes. One day I picked up a rock and the snake went into the ravine. And one day I got there and picked up the rock. And when I saw it turn around and start to move, I screamed.
[00:07:08.020] - Speaker 1
He's getting up.
[00:07:09.600] - Speaker 3
And it stands well, well. Straight.
[00:07:11.800] - Speaker 1
It stands up straight.
[00:07:13.330] - Speaker 3
And when I see him pick up that snake on the road, that's why he followed me all the way here to the door.
[00:07:17.750] - Speaker 1
That's called a torch, isn't it?
[00:07:19.020] - Speaker 3
Yes, the torch. I got to that brooch and carved it like that. I was carrying my lunch box with my lunch in it. And I said, "What?" Everything fell out. And I got up there and he said, "Why did you come up like that?" No, what did you say to him? A snake was chasing me. He said, "What?" And I said, "Well, walk and you'll see the snake's trail." And since it was summer, the dust on the road was dry. And that snake left a mark from the way it was moving. It chased me to a brooch, but far away. I looked back and saw the snake. And it left a trail.
[00:07:51.380] - Speaker 1
I was going to catch up. Yes, that's the other one I recognize, the one I know is very tough.
[00:08:01.240] - Speaker 3
But now there are hardly any of those left.
[00:08:02.750] - Speaker 1
Eggs are also a snake, but they call them eggs, right? They are a snake that is the wave of
[00:08:08.730] - Speaker 3
The mitabo.
[00:08:09.010] - Speaker 1
Yes, the hitado. And in other places they call them huevo, and in the Amazon they call them What are they called? Bohan.
[00:08:15.380] - Speaker 3
Four noses. No, Bohan, right?
[00:08:16.560] - Speaker 1
They are what they are
[00:08:18.910] - Speaker 2
But I don't know, it's poison.
[00:08:20.360] - Speaker 1
They're huge. There are already too many animals. Oh my, sir! I've never seen rolls like that before. Yes, of course.
[00:08:27.460] - Speaker 3
Some rolls killed them. I was telling Pablo, my brother-in-law, that he takes the racks from here and pulls them to
[00:08:33.360] - Speaker 1
Until they get sick of them. And they get sick of them and go to bed for a year. Imagine the legend, what some indigenous people used to say, because we live in the jungle, and some indigenous people told us that a fugitive catches the snake, the web from its nose, and until they kill it, they defend it and eat it and go to bed to sleep for a year. The animals sleep for a long time. Of course, because their stomachs are so big. Yes. And they chew and chew and chew and chew and chew. But thank God, thank the Virgin Mary, around here, she makes me come here, to this farm, over there like that. No, bless the sky.
[00:09:15.130] - Speaker 3
For a long time, ever since that snake followed me, I haven't been able to light a torch.
[00:09:17.780] - Speaker 1
I haven't looked at any snakes, nor would I look at one because I now have the strength to quickly grab a stick and kill it.
[00:09:24.400] - Speaker 3
I killed a snake. I killed a small one and a big one, right?
[00:09:28.360] - Speaker 1
No, you have to hit it right in the middle.
[00:09:32.470] - Speaker 3
Yes, you have to hit them on the head.
[00:09:34.810] - Speaker 1
Right in the middle. In the middle. So, you find a stick and try to hit it right in the middle. It breaks her spine, she can't run anywhere. She's going to throw you, but since she's broken, she can't throw you yet.
[00:09:47.210] - Speaker 3
He cannot walk.
[00:09:48.110] - Speaker 1
No, but only after you break his spine. That's what they taught me over there, when we were there on the visit.
[00:09:53.470] - Speaker 3
And it doesn't drag?
[00:09:54.590] - Speaker 1
No, because it's broken. That's why I don't hold back. I wasn't afraid of that, because you hit it in the middle and the snake doesn't And it's more dangerous, you hit it on the head and it turns around and hits you with its tail. And usually, several snakes have a little hook on their tail.
[00:10:17.270] - Speaker 2
Well, thank you very much. Yes, sir. And it's important to know what to do after a snake bite and your right to go to the hospital. And it's important to know what kind of snake bit you, to take a picture or kill it and take it to the hospital. But anyway, thank you very much. You're welcome, good luck.
