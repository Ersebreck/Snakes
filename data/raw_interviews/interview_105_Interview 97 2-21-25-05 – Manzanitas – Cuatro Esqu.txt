[00:02:26.590] - Speaker 1

And the question is, would you trust them more? Sorry. In hospitals in general, more than Carmen or others, if you know what I mean.
[00:03:09.800] - Speaker 1
Suddenly, there are so many hospitals and all kinds of places where they can send you, because they send you somewhere several times, but there are no beds, there is no service, so they send you somewhere else, and then
[00:03:22.420] - Speaker 2
And where do you feel most likely to be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:03:30.540] - Speaker 1
That happens several times, when you're about to die, the animal grabs you and one single bite and that's it. At least the bite itself is deadly. It lasts about five minutes and then you're done. You're lying there in the field for a little while, and when they take you away, they dance because you're already dead.
[00:03:57.900] - Speaker 2
And do you know how to identify poisonous snakes or venomous snakes?
[00:04:03.010] - Speaker 1
Sure, yes.
[00:04:04.830] - Speaker 2
How do you identify snakes?
[00:04:08.310] - Speaker 1
There are several sizes, you know what I mean? Uh-huh. Yes.
[00:04:13.110] - Speaker 2
And if you need to go to the hospital, is that difficult for you or easy?
[00:04:22.730] - Speaker 1
Sometimes you're working, doing whatever, and you feel an itch, and suddenly, if there's no service at that moment, they're going to leave you there. So when you get to the hospital, you're already in bad shape, you could die, they can revive you, give you drugs and all that stuff. Well, you come back to life, but you're always scarred by that experience. At least the rot, wherever it itches, keeps rotting. And that is a real death. There are so many poisonous snakes here that Of course.
[00:04:59.840] - Speaker 2
Sure, yes. Well, I don't have any more questions, but do you have anything else to say about snakes or your knowledge, anything else? No, because there are poisonous snakes everywhere, animals are poisonous.
[00:05:14.440] - Speaker 1
Sure. That's all then.
[00:05:16.680] - Speaker 2
Yes, of course. And it's important, after a snake bite, you need to go straight to the hospital, and it's important to know what kind of snake bit you, because there are different antivenoms for different snakes. Yes, of course. You can take a picture of the snake, or you can kill it and take it to the hospital. Yes, of course. It's important to know. But yes, thank you very much. I don't have any more questions. Yes, of course.
