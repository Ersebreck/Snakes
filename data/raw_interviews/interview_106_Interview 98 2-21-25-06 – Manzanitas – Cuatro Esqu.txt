Eight years ago.
[00:00:29.220] - Speaker 1
So, do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:34.740] - Speaker 2
What do you mean, you can't see it?
[00:00:36.900] - Speaker 1
Do you think it's possible to get bitten by a snake here in this area? Yes, of course. Why?
[00:00:46.040] - Speaker 2
Because there are lots of little hills and lots of forest. Then they arrive.
[00:00:50.360] - Speaker 1
Yes, of course. And have any of your animals ever been bitten by a snake? No.
[00:00:58.320] - Speaker 2
Thank God, no.
[00:01:00.260] - Speaker 1
And do you know how to prevent or avoid a snake bite?
[00:01:06.160] - Speaker 2
Yes, I have heard, but I'm not sure.
[00:01:08.820] - Speaker 1
What are you listening to?
[00:01:11.120] - Speaker 2
Well, there is one downside, I think it's a little animal. I don't know if it's like a snake bite, but I'm not sure if that's what it is or not.
[00:01:20.610] - Speaker 1
And before a snake bite, do you know how to avoid bites or snakes?
[00:01:27.760] - Speaker 2
I've heard that they tie them tightly with something to prevent the poison from rising to a certain point, but I'm not sure.
[00:01:37.570] - Speaker 1
And what would you do if a snake bit you?
[00:01:40.610] - Speaker 2
I don't know at this moment. Yes, of course, I don't know what I would do at that moment.
[00:01:45.950] - Speaker 1
Yes, okay, no problem. And would you trust the hospital in Carmen to treat a snake bite?
[00:01:53.440] - Speaker 2
Well, it's improved a lot now. Suddenly, yes. It's improved quite a bit.
[00:02:00.170] - Speaker 1
And would you also trust other hospitals, such as Carmen, near Carmen?
[00:02:05.670] - Speaker 2
Yes, Cilaro. It's good. And Espinal is also a very good hospital.
[00:02:10.220] - Speaker 1
And where do you feel you are most likely to be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:02:19.740] - Speaker 2
Well, mostly like in the countryside. Always at home, because when it rains a lot, they look for shelter in houses. So that's why we have to stay indoors.
[00:02:30.400] - Speaker 1
And do you know how to identify poisonous and non-poisonous snakes?
[00:02:34.870] - Speaker 2
Very little. I've heard that there's a lot of bullying here. People have killed a lot of people around here. And the poor woman, I've heard you.
[00:02:44.160] - Speaker 1
And how do you identify the size?
[00:02:48.950] - Speaker 2
The size is because it has sequins and the rot is like blue. The color is different, yes, it does.
[00:02:58.000] - Speaker 1
And do you know of a case of a snake crying?
[00:03:01.820] - Speaker 2
Well, recently, yes, in the woods, a snake bit a child, who was about three years old.
[00:03:08.480] - Speaker 1
In the countryside?
[00:03:09.440] - Speaker 2
That was in a park. I was with his mom and she bit him. But I think the boy is a little better, he's a little more alert. And if you need to go to the hospital, is that difficult for you or is it easy? Well, right now it's a little easier. Before it wasn't, because we don't have transportation, but now we do.
[00:03:33.920] - Speaker 1
Well, that's good. I don't have any more questions, but do you have anything else to say about snakes or your knowledge of snakes or anything else?
[00:03:42.380] - Speaker 2
Snakes. Many people say that you shouldn't kill them because they're dying out. But if one bites you, then you have to kill it. But if you go looking for them, well, that's their habit. That's different. But if they come into the house, then yes, it's different. Yes, of course. We killed one here recently. But it wasn't one of the poisonous ones, it was one of the big ones that eats chicken eggs. My husband killed it. And there was one up there. My husband killed that one too.
[00:04:16.040] - Speaker 1
They're horrible.
[00:04:17.810] - Speaker 2
Those snakes are horrible, aren't they? I can't stand them. I always have to spray them with poison. Or if I don't have to use that too much, because I can't be without Crioline. Criolean. They smell it and I prefer to spray them. But never in my life, since I saw the first snake, since I started using this, have I ever seen the first snake or its venom. They're very good, very effective. It's ugly, the smell is horrible, but it's very good.
[00:04:46.670] - Speaker 1
Yes, of course. Well, it's also important to know that after a snake bite, you need to go straight to the hospital. And it's important to know what kind of snake bit you, because there are different antivenoms for different snakes, and you can take a picture of the snake or you can kill it and take it to the hospital. But it's important to know what kind of snake bit you. You will have a snake bite, but hopefully you won't.
[00:05:21.470] - Speaker 2
No, not even a friend. I didn't talk to him about it. That's terrible.
[00:05:27.690] - Speaker 1
And your friend died too?
[00:05:32.010] - Speaker 2
The boy, the child?
[00:05:34.130] - Speaker 1
No, no, no. Yes, okay. Well, that's all I have. Thank you very much. Well, take care. Thank you.
[00:05:44.000] - Speaker 2
Where are you from?
