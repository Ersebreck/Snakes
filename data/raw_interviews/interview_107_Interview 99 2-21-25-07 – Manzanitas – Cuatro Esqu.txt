[00:00:29.620] - Speaker 2
So, so you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:34.520] - Speaker 1
Around here, if you're not careful, a snake will bite you. Why? Because snakes pass through there. Once they put me in there, we're going to show it on TV when a long one like that got in. You lock yourself in, look at the snake, it stood there with a comb, my God. Allergies, like red. How scary. I was here, we were talking there when I went to get the vaccine, the corals, they'll kill you.
[00:01:03.680] - Speaker 2
How scary. At most, snakes are very cute.
[00:01:07.700] - Speaker 1
They don't take much care about that.
[00:01:10.820] - Speaker 2
And have any of your animals ever been bitten by a snake?
[00:01:14.220] - Speaker 1
But that was a long time ago. My brother was bitten when we were studying, but that was a while ago. It bit him here on his foot.
[00:01:21.590] - Speaker 2
And did he die? No.
[00:01:22.860] - Speaker 1
They took him to the doctor and alerted him.
[00:01:26.410] - Speaker 2
An animal or a person?
[00:01:28.620] - Speaker 1
A snake.
[00:01:29.960] - Speaker 2
But the question was, has any of your animals been out there? My brother. But your brother. And was the snake poisonous?
[00:01:42.290] - Speaker 1
That day, the snake got lost because it went over to the box where we grew up. It was around six in the afternoon when we got home from school, and it disappeared around six in the afternoon. It had one dark eye. My dad came to look for me and said, "No, it's not here. We couldn't find it." And the snake was lost. We couldn't see what kind of snake it was.
[00:01:59.660] - Speaker 2
But he needed it.
[00:02:02.280] - Speaker 1
We put him on a stretcher because there are no roads up there. Then we carried him on the stretcher to here, where the car picked him up, and called the doctor. The doctor attended to him quickly.
[00:02:13.870] - Speaker 2
And did he receive an anti-inflammatory?
[00:02:16.230] - Speaker 1
Sure, they stuck a hose in his nose, and he started reciting the poison prayer.
[00:02:25.500] - Speaker 2
And has any of your animals ever been like that? And has its head ever been bitten off by a snake?
[00:02:34.890] - Speaker 1
No, he hasn't left, no. Dad lasted a long time, but he was working, and he never hit her. I was terrified. Did you see that he used to carry a sack like the ones they use for cocoa? He used to carry sacks of chili peppers. The guys would pull the sack like this, they would pull the sack. My dad turned around and looked, and there was a snake with its fangs in him, pulling on the sack. It was a snake, a very thick one. My dad, with just a comb, listened and let it go.
[00:03:03.390] - Speaker 2
How scary.
[00:03:06.050] - Speaker 1
Dad knew many prayers for snakes because they never bit him.
[00:03:12.710] - Speaker 2
And do you know how to prevent a snake bite?
[00:03:19.090] - Speaker 1
Well, one of them took another trip to the doctor.
[00:03:21.600] - Speaker 2
But before a snake bite, do you have any methods of prevention?
[00:03:27.150] - Speaker 1
Maybe they gave my brother a job while we were taking him to the doctor. Because nowadays, people just let themselves die.
[00:03:37.970] - Speaker 2
And what would you do if a snake bit you?
[00:03:43.650] - Speaker 1
What if a snake bites you? What would you do if a snake died? What if a snake dies?
[00:03:45.300] - Speaker 2
What would you do if a snake died?
[00:03:48.430] - Speaker 1
If you were bitten by a snake, what would you do? What would I do? I'm not telling you to do it for the doctor, because what else would you do? Why wouldn't you know? No. Which doctor?
[00:04:00.950] - Speaker 2
Which doctor? Which one? In Carmen? In Carmen. And would you trust the hospital in Carmen to cure you?
[00:04:10.580] - Speaker 1
No, here in Carmen, you arrive and, since there isn't this, they suddenly refer you to turn around twice. Because there, they don't let you die. The hospital doesn't Then, they blow the whistle. But they refer you to turn around twice.
[00:04:25.310] - Speaker 2
And where do you feel it's most likely to happen? And what do you think a snake would bite you? In the countryside or at home?
[00:04:33.210] - Speaker 1
In the countryside, but that's not true there. The pastures and stuff. Why? Of course, sometimes they've been bitten at home. A friend of mine went to pee and stepped on a snake and once stepped on a snake's foot. Really? Man, that one got it. That's for sure. The snake went to pee and she stepped on it. And it bit her.
[00:04:59.070] - Speaker 2
Once? And you don't know?
[00:05:00.860] - Speaker 1
Sure. Those are those shoes, they rot your feet. They rushed him to the doctor, his foot rotted, and finally, from all the drugs, they're Now Florentino's son, right? That boy almost lost his foot. This is Javier. He almost lost everything, it lasted a long time, let's see if he's recovered. Burned, yes.
[00:05:29.960] - Speaker 2
And do you know how to identify poisonous snakes or snakes that are venomous?
[00:05:34.920] - Speaker 1
There is one, the X is very poisonous, the size. And right now, as you can see, they are rooted in the size, in And what about the X or the zapa? Ouch! Those are very serious. They sting you and then they kill you.
[00:05:53.280] - Speaker 2
And how do you identify poisonous or venomous snakes?
[00:05:59.260] - Speaker 1
I mean, I know the X, because I grew up at my dad's meetings, where they made some really big ones. An X there, here on top. And the size too, because you know what size it is.
[00:06:12.330] - Speaker 2
And do you know of any cases like that? Yes, okay. And if you need to go to the hospital, is that difficult for you or easy?
[00:06:21.410] - Speaker 1
It's difficult because it affects everyone, every single one of us, so people ask me, "Who supports you?" Yes, okay. I grab the phone quickly because sometimes you don't have any minutes left. Of course, yes. The countryside is tough, you suffer a lot because of it.
[00:06:39.590] - Speaker 2
Well, I don't have any more questions, but do you have anything else to say about snakes or your knowledge of snakes or anything else? No, I don't.
[00:06:51.150] - Speaker 1
Let's leave it at that.
[00:06:53.240] - Speaker 2
And well, yes, it's important to know after a snake bite, do you need to go straight to the hospital? And it's important to know what kind of snake bit you, because there are different antivenoms for different You have to take it with you, right?
[00:07:09.190] - Speaker 1
