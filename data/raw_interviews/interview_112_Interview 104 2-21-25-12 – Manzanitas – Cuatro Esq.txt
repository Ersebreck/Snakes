[00:00:18.810] - Speaker 2
What do you do for a living? Do you work? I'm away from the countryside a lot. Are you married or single?
[00:00:29.490] - Speaker 1
Single, but I have a child, I'm not married. Okay.
[00:00:34.230] - Speaker 2
How old are you? Sorry. You have children. I see. Okay. And how long have you lived in Carmen?
[00:00:44.730] - Speaker 1
All my life.
[00:00:47.130] - Speaker 2
So, do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:52.890] - Speaker 1
Probably. Why? Because there's nothing here to go to. Okay. And they're already paginating to turn everything around so that the rest gets bitten off as quickly as possible. Okay.
[00:01:09.740] - Speaker 2
Have any of your animals or pets ever been bitten by a snake?
[00:01:16.190] - Speaker 1
Yes, but many years ago. A cat, a kitten, and it bit him.
[00:01:23.120] - Speaker 2
And did he die? Yes, he did. And do you know how to prevent or avoid a snake bite?
[00:01:31.800] - Speaker 1
Prevention is walking around with your eyes open and taking care of them. And you'll see, you walk around, but then you have to kill the little bitch.
[00:01:42.160] - Speaker 2
Sure.
[00:01:42.640] - Speaker 1
Is it her or is it one?
[00:01:44.130] - Speaker 2
Yes, of course. And what would you do if a snake died?
[00:01:50.260] - Speaker 1
Well, start looking for a health center right there and try to get one, right?
[00:01:56.830] - Speaker 2
Yes, yes. It's fabulous. And which health center would you go to?
[00:02:04.590] - Speaker 1
The first one, I have, would have to go to Melgar.
[00:02:08.190] - Speaker 2
Why Melgar?
[00:02:09.820] - Speaker 1
Because they treat me there with my health insurance. And where do you think you're most likely to get bitten by a snake?
[00:02:21.880] - Speaker 2
In the countryside or at home?
[00:02:26.240] - Speaker 1
Well, there have been cases around here where they bite him in the field, at home, and in the countryside.
[00:02:33.270] - Speaker 2
Yes, of course. And do you know how to identify poisonous snakes or venomous snakes? And how do you identify snakes?
[00:02:45.770] - Speaker 1
So, they have already told the child: This is such-and-such a snake, this is such-and-such, and this is the other one.
[00:02:54.030] - Speaker 2
And do you know of a case of a snake bite? What happened in that case?
[00:03:01.640] - Speaker 1
Well, over in Peño Blanco, a woman was bitten, right? By a snake. Another woman was bitten by something, but they didn't know if it was a snake or what it was. Later, he found out that it wasn't a snake, but they had applied snake medicine to her.
[00:03:23.010] - Speaker 2
And if you need to go to the hospital, is that difficult for you or easy?
[00:03:31.400] - Speaker 1
Not that difficult. Depending on where I was in the house, it's not difficult.
[00:03:39.190] - Speaker 2
But if I go out there in the countryside, yes. It's harder, yes.
[00:03:43.140] - Speaker 1
Mount.
[00:03:44.570] - Speaker 2
Well, I don't have any more questions, but you have more to say about snakes or your knowledge.
[00:03:52.370] - Speaker 1
Tell me, what would you do? If I bite something, what should I do?
[00:03:56.360] - Speaker 2
Yes, that's right. Good afternoon, how are you? Fine.
[00:04:03.960] - Speaker 1
Thank you. All right, sir.
[00:04:06.710] - Speaker 2
Well, it's important to know that after a snake bite, you need to go straight to the hospital, and it's important to know what kind of snake bit you, because there are different antivenoms for different snakes. You can take a picture of the snake or you can kill it and take it to the hospital. And yes, that's the most important information.
[00:04:34.510] - Speaker 1
It is more essential.
[00:04:35.680] - Speaker 2
Yes. But thank you very much, you're very kind.
[00:04:40.680] - Speaker 1
To you, because no one ever comes here, if they come once.
[00:04:46.470] - Speaker 2
Imagine.
[00:04:47.480] - Speaker 1
For bringing the general here as a guide.
