No.
[00:00:35.560] - Speaker 2
Why?
[00:00:36.980] - Speaker 1
Well, I don't know, because saying it's worse tomorrow is like talking about dirt, things like that, or that one spends a lot of time, let's say, in the fields, things like that.
[00:00:49.790] - Speaker 2
And have any of your animals or pets ever been bitten by a snake? A cat. How long ago was that? And how long ago did he die? About three years ago. And did he die?

Yes.
[00:01:08.200] - Speaker 2
And do you know how to prevent or avoid a snake bite?
[00:01:14.830] - Speaker 1
Well, most people say to make a tourniquet where she bit him and go to the hospital quickly. And if possible, find out what kind of snake it is so they can give him the right antivenom. Yes, that's important.
[00:01:32.570] - Speaker 2
And before a snake bite, do you know how to prevent or avoid snake bites? No. And what would you do if you were bitten by a snake?
[00:01:45.410] - Speaker 1
Well, I would do what most people recommend: apply a tourniquet, see what kind of animal it was, because there are several kinds of snakes, and go to the hospital.
[00:02:00.400] - Speaker 2
Which hospital would you go to?
[00:02:02.070] - Speaker 1
The one here, Carmen de Picala. It says you have to go to the one closest to where you are.
[00:02:09.750] - Speaker 2
And would you trust the hospital in Carmen to treat a snake bite?
[00:02:16.230] - Speaker 1
As long as they had How do you say it? Like serum, that's it. Although I understand that here in Carmen, when this happens, they give first aid and then transport the person to a better hospital...
[00:02:31.030] - Speaker 2
Higher level. And if you need to go to the hospital, is that easy for you or difficult?
[00:02:43.390] - Speaker 1
Well, always, and when we put her on a motorcycle or something that can transport her, or a car, a motorcycle taxi, something like that.
[00:02:53.150] - Speaker 2
And where do you feel you are most likely to be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:03:00.020] - Speaker 1
In the countryside.
[00:03:01.900] - Speaker 2
Why?
[00:03:03.570] - Speaker 1
Well, they say that where there are more pastures, there are more trees and things like that. And they say that she built a house because, when it's very hot, they look for cooler places.
[00:03:17.100] - Speaker 2
I don't know if that's true. And do you know how to identify poisonous snakes or non-poisonous snakes? No. And do you know of any cases of snake bites? No. No? Okay, well, I don't have any more questions, but do you have anything else to say about snakes or your knowledge of snakes? No. No? Okay, fine. Okay. And it's important to know after a snake bite and the right hospital to go to. And you know, but it's important to know what kind of snake bit you, because, exactly, you said there are different antivenoms for different snakes. You can take a picture of the snake or you can kill it and take it to the hospital. And yes, I don't have any more questions. Thank you very much for your time, very kind of you. Bye.
