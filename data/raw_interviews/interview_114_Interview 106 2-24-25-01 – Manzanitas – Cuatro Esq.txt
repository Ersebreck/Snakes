How old are you?
[00:00:14.120] - Speaker 1
76.
[00:00:15.580] - Speaker 2
Are you married or single?
[00:00:17.510] - Speaker 1
Common-law marriage.
[00:00:18.980] - Speaker 2
Do you have children?
[00:00:20.570] - Speaker 1
Two.
[00:00:21.500] - Speaker 2
And how many years have you lived in Al Carmen?
[00:00:24.690] - Speaker 1
All my life.
[00:00:26.040] - Speaker 2
So, do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:32.680] - Speaker 1
Well, the most likely first aid measure is that of the borugo.
[00:00:38.710] - Speaker 2
Okay. But do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here? Are snakes a possibility here or not?
[00:00:48.970] - Speaker 1
Wherever, anywhere.
[00:00:51.180] - Speaker 2
Here at home or out in the country?
[00:00:53.530] - Speaker 1
Wherever, yes.
[00:00:55.020] - Speaker 2
Yes? Okay. Why do you think that's likely?
[00:00:59.240] - Speaker 1
Because that's the first thing you have to do. Everyone around here, all hunters, anyone who works in the fields, gets burujo gel.
[00:01:10.410] - Speaker 2
Okay.
[00:01:11.470] - Speaker 1
You bite it and then you mix it with aguardiente or whatever you have and take a teaspoonful and drink it before you go anywhere. It takes effect within 24 hours. Okay. That's the pressure. Because there are some who put the adigena on the cane, the suaza, they put it in a cross and put it on to draw out the poison. But we haven't tried that here.
[00:01:40.960] - Speaker 2
Would you go to the hospital after a snake bite?
[00:01:47.270] - Speaker 1
Sure, you have to go so they can put you on an IV.
[00:01:50.970] - Speaker 2
Okay.
[00:01:51.440] - Speaker 1
Yes. But that's so they don't So they don't beat him up at the hospital, because that snake, the one with the sick woman, if you go back there, you won't live to tell the tale, they'll kill you.
[00:02:10.830] - Speaker 2
Would you use the one in Burugo and also go to ¿Y tal? Yes. Have any of your animals ever been bitten by a snake?
[00:02:25.640] - Speaker 1
My dad bit him three times.
[00:02:28.200] - Speaker 2
Really? Which one?
[00:02:29.310] - Speaker 1
Yes, and that's what he took.
[00:02:32.150] - Speaker 2
What about poisonous snakes?
[00:02:36.210] - Speaker 1
Sure. He bit him once, bit him again, and bit him a third time.
[00:02:46.100] - Speaker 2
And did he go to the hospital every time?
[00:02:48.880] - Speaker 1
He took it and it lasted. It lasted about five months, then he went to Girardón and there was a pregnant woman on the bus. When he got to Girardón, his leg was purple, purple. He had to go to the hospital. And then they told him what it was. They always run out of that serum they give you The serum is what fights the poison.
[00:03:14.370] - Speaker 2
Well, yes. And do you know how to identify poisonous snakes or venomous snakes?
[00:03:24.560] - Speaker 1
Do I know which ones are poisonous?
[00:03:27.800] - Speaker 2
Can you identify different snakes?
[00:03:31.850] - Speaker 1
Sure. There's the small one, the big one, and the common one. There's the coral one, the rotten one, and the tocha, which is also tough. There's the granadilla.
[00:03:44.940] - Speaker 2
And how do you identify snakes?
[00:03:50.900] - Speaker 1
In the colors. The male coral has a black head and the female is pure red. That's it. In the colors. That's right, because that's the only thing that's different.
[00:04:08.730] - Speaker 2
And if you need to go to the hospital, is that difficult for you or easy?
[00:04:17.660] - Speaker 1
No, you always have to go to the hospital, you always have to.
[00:04:21.170] - Speaker 2
But if you need to go to the hospital, is it difficult or easy to get there?
[00:04:28.460] - Speaker 1
From here, until you get to Carmen, call Tolemaira and they will send it to you. If they have the serum, because they sell it here in Tolemaira, they will send it to you, they don't sell it. You ask them what kind of snake killed him, what kind of snake bit him, and they will send the serum there.
[00:04:49.930] - Speaker 2
Do you have a motorcycle to go to the hospital, or do you have a car?
[00:04:58.580] - Speaker 1
No, anyone can come here. I don't have anything here, but if I help my neighbors, I go to their houses, and they let me in.
[00:05:06.280] - Speaker 2
And would you trust the hospital in Carmen to cure a snake bite? No.
[00:05:13.340] - Speaker 1
Why? No, because he's not qualified. At best, they'll give him And he's not qualified because he always has to go to Girardoa, Espinal, or Ibaguen.
[00:05:25.380] - Speaker 2
And where do you feel it is most likely to happen? And why is it likely that a snake would bite you? At home or in the countryside?
[00:05:35.810] - Speaker 1
In the countryside, in the pastures.
[00:05:39.850] - Speaker 2
Okay. Why?
[00:05:41.310] - Speaker 1
Because they already keep them over there, on the banks of the Quebradas. When it's your turn to go to work, you have to be ready to go.
[00:05:47.810] - Speaker 2
Yes, of course. And do you know of any other cases of snake bites? You mentioned your father, but any others?
[00:06:01.660] - Speaker 1
A little bit, because it has been bitten each time, perhaps by the snake.
[00:06:06.140] - Speaker 2
Because I said so.
[00:06:07.680] - Speaker 1
But they always have that obstacle to overcome in order to get to the hospitals. Because that's true, that's terrible. Yes.
[00:06:21.310] - Speaker 2
That was a dead one of those animals. Well, thank you very much for your time, I don't have any more questions. No, no. Do you have anything else to say about snakes or your knowledge of snakes or anything else?
[00:06:38.980] - Speaker 1
No. Not from the snake.
[00:06:41.690] - Speaker 2
The most important information is that after a snake bite, you need to go straight to the hospital, right? Yes, that's right. And is it important to know what kind of snake bit you?
[00:06:56.970] - Speaker 1
Yes, ma'am.
[00:06:57.730] - Speaker 2
Because there are different antivenoms for different snakes.
[00:07:01.000] - Speaker 1
And there is one that has the strongest poison and another that has less.
[00:07:04.790] - Speaker 2
Yes, it could be. Yes. Yes? Yes.
[00:07:07.680] - Speaker 1
The coral has a very strong poison.
[00:07:10.820] - Speaker 2
Yes, the poisonous ones are different. Yes, yes, ma'am. They are different, yes. But anyway, thank you very much for your time. Okay. Well, that's it. Okay. Thank you. Bye.
