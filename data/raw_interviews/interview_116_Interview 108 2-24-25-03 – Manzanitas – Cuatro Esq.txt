Yes, as I said. I was married, but I am no longer married. I no longer have a spouse. Do you have children? Yes, sir. I have five, four girls and a boy, but one set was twins.
[00:00:36.960] - Speaker 1
And how many years have you lived here in El Carmen?
[00:00:41.060] - Speaker 2
In El Carmen all my life.
[00:00:43.970] - Speaker 1
I'm moving closer. Ma'am, calm down. And move away from the snake, okay?
[00:00:54.690] - Speaker 2
Yes, ma'am, I was bitten by a snake.
[00:00:57.390] - Speaker 1
And what happened?
[00:01:00.330] - Speaker 2
Hello? Hello. And that julebra. And that animal, it was tiny, it was like that, and that animal almost killed me. I spent 20 days in intensive care, a size X, rotting, and I got ulcers. Every year I get an ulcer. Take it off, take it off, take it off. I'll show you where it bit me. Look, it bit me here, in this part, and I've got two ulcers there. And on the side I've got eight ulcers. I mean, it's been biting me for almost eight years. Every year I got an ulcer. And right now the one that healed, it healed two months ago, almost three months ago, in December, it healed and I had it for a year. That was here. It covered all of me. Look, it covered all of me like this. And here I got another one, look, here I got another one. Another one appeared here. And today I'm seeing a doctor in Girardón and sometimes he treats me, sometimes I stay there to get treated and go back and forth, and he gives me medicine and everything.
[00:02:08.350] - Speaker 2
And when it bit me, I felt very weak. Not like that, but like I was going to faint. And finally, my whole leg hurt, which was when they had me in the hospital, because I was there for 20 days.
[00:02:22.660] - Speaker 1
In Bogotá? Intensive care. In Bogotá?
[00:02:25.610] - Speaker 2
Intensive care, in Girardón. And then it bit me there, on that road going downhill. The snake was in a meadow and I stepped on some brush and it bit me, and it was small. So I went to the Carmen hospital, but it bit me at eight in the morning and from there I Eight in the morning? Yes, it bit me at eight in the morning and they took me to the Girardón hospital at two-thirty in the afternoon because there was no ambulance and I had to go on a motorcycle. But it doesn't hurt much, except the poison goes up and you start turning yellow, like really yellow, and your mouth fills with foam from the poison. I was covered in foam and couldn't speak. Three days after they gave me that poison, the one they give you, they gave it to me there in Girardoy, but three days later they gave it to me. And then I didn't see her in the bed where she was. And my eyes closed, I swelled up completely, my whole head was swollen, I couldn't open my mouth, it was like it was stuck shut, like that, horrible.
[00:03:44.770] - Speaker 2
Yes, that's awful. And then it stayed there, I could hardly eat, it hurt so much.
[00:03:51.740] - Speaker 1
And did you receive the anti-physics immediately upon turning it on?
[00:03:56.170] - Speaker 2
Yes, they turned me around and put it on me, yes. And that's what made me like this, all swollen and with so much pain that they told me that if it was that snake, and yes, I know them because they have X. And suddenly it was rotten because it was like a rotten stick. I stepped on the stick and it crumbled, and out came the snake. And the man who saw me, the doctor, said it was a rotten snake, he said: And you already have the poison there. But they told me about a herb, and so I bathed with that herb and look, it's actually quite good, I have to do it again, because they say it draws out the poison that comes out through the pores. And the doctor in Girardot did tell me: You have the poison, you still have poison from the snake. Because when it bit me, a little blood came out and I washed it off. And they say you shouldn't wash it off, that it's bad to bathe when a snake bites you, to bathe the part where it bit you.
[00:04:59.686] - Speaker 2
So, I bathed because I had gotten muddy and I had to walk there again.
[00:05:04.960] - Speaker 2
So, when I arrived, I arrived exhausted, when I got there to the house, and I lived there on the side of the road. I arrived exhausted, feeling very weak. And thank goodness there was a guy there from the hospital who said to me: "Ma'am, you've been bitten by a snake. I said, "Yes, sir." He said, "Walk to the hospital." And I got on his motorcycle. He has a motorcycle. And I got on and left. And there, while I was there, the nurses took me. But they told me that when you're bitten by a snake, a pregnant woman can't look at it. And that woman touched me, and she was a pregnant nurse. And she squeezed me like this, squeezed me like this, and it started to hurt. I said, "Oh, my God, I already washed it, I don't have it. What is the poison?" I told her, 'No, I don't have anything because I'm going to wash myself.
[00:05:57.764] - Speaker 2
' And there I was, still in that horrible pain. After she did that to me, it hurt. And I went to Girarduas and they took me there. And there, yes, they took good care of me, but then the day they gave me that other poison, right?
[00:06:12.710] - Speaker 2
Snake venom. They put it on me and then I got really sick. After I came back, a woman came to see me. I don't know if she was pregnant too or what, but she hurt me a lot, really a lot. They had to take me out in the early morning, but my whole leg was in so much pain that I was screaming. They took me and gave me an injection and told me, "You have to stay." So I stayed, and I had company; I had to stay with someone. Then one of the daughters stayed with me, and the next day another one replaced her. The other one stayed because she's chubby and had to sleep on the floor; there was no bed. The other one was thinner, and she slept in the bed with me. Later, during the day, they gave me an injection here, and I bled a lot, a lot of blood. And they gave me dialysis. The snake venom went to my lungs and then to my kidneys, that's what they said.
[00:07:11.700] - Speaker 2
And they gave me that injection and a lot of blood came out, a lot. They said, "We have to take her to Bogotá." And after a while, I was calming down, and they said, "No, not anymore, she's not going."
[00:07:26.050] - Speaker 2
So, they kept me there for eight days and then sent me home. But I couldn't even sit up. I couldn't even hold a spoon. I was very discouraged, very discouraged. The spoon was too heavy for me to eat with, so everyone had to hold my hand. Each of my children would take one of my arms, because I got tired in bed, so they would lift me up to walk around and I would cry my eyes out. But I had never felt so weak. I don't know why, but that animal bite affected me so much. And my leg was this thick, all the way down to my foot. And it still makes me fat, you see? And it's thinner now. And it still makes me fat, even after all this time. But now look, I've stuck to Aruños, because around here in the countryside, it scratches everywhere it goes. And I've stuck to Aruñitos and it tries to draw blood, but it calms down. It comes back and heals me.
[00:08:32.155] - Speaker 2
Before, no, as soon as a mosquito bit me, I would scratch and there would be a wound. Yes, so that snake bite was terrible.
[00:08:41.920] - Speaker 2
And the lady who got bitten there, she was also very small, just like the snake, and she passed by and shone her flashlight and saw a toad standing there. There was the toad, so she shone the light on it. Then the pinch came. I have to get it. Oh, Duán. My little boy helps me catch the pizca. Then she lay down because it was Saturday and her husband was drinking with the children. Then she That was at night and she went out with the flashlight and shone it and she saw the toad. And from there to here she didn't shine the light anymore. And that's when she caught it, stepped on it, she tripped and the animal bit her on a tube. And there she said, "No, it doesn't hurt, it doesn't hurt." And I already took a pill, and her husband and children arrived, and she said, "No, I already took a pill and now I don't... Do I have it? Yes, that's why you have to catch it.
[00:09:47.718] - Speaker 2
Don't let it get away." So she stayed like that, and in the early morning she got very sick. So they took her away and kept her there for 15 days. They were going to let her out that day, on a Monday.
[00:10:03.580] - Speaker 2
They said she was better, that we could take her home. She was about to leave when she got worse, she made me sick, and in the afternoon she died. And I was like, "Oh no." Mom, that's how I was, but I held on for a long time to give myself hope, but I still feel weak, like I'm falling asleep. And I fell asleep everywhere. Right now, I'm taking the medicine I buy there, things to help my blood circulate, for when my kidneys are bad, for when my lungs are bad, they give me all that.
[00:10:49.110] - Speaker 1
And in your case with the snake bite, what did you do after the bite? Immediately after the bite, did you go to the hospital or did you apply a tourniquet or something else?
[00:11:08.730] - Speaker 2
No, I didn't use a tourniquet or anything.
[00:11:11.840] - Speaker 1
Did you go to the hospital by yourself?
[00:11:13.530] - Speaker 2
Yes, they just took me away, not to the hospital, and from there they took me to Girardón.
[00:11:17.440] - Speaker 1
Okay.
[00:11:18.030] - Speaker 2
Yes, because they didn't do it to me They didn't do it to me there... They gave me an injection, they put me on... I don't know what the injection was for, because it wasn't for the snake bite or anything. It was an injection there, probably for the pain, yes, it hurt, but it didn't hurt that much. I felt weak, like I was losing my strength. But now I see that snakes bite people and they don't get that bad. I don't know why.
[00:11:46.770] - Speaker 1
Did you know that tourniquets are bad for bites?
[00:11:52.950] - Speaker 2
What do you mean?
[00:11:55.730] - Speaker 1
When the bite healed, did you know that a tourniquet wasn't a good idea? Or why didn't you use a tourniquet? Why did you go to the hospital after the bite? How did you know?
[00:12:14.520] - Speaker 2
No, I didn't have anything to make a tourniquet with. There wasn't anything, because they say that a tourniquet is something you tie around yourself, right? But there wasn't anything, because they say that if you tie it around yourself, nothing happens. Because a child was bitten, just like him, he was bitten by one too, but it was big, it was really big. It was big because it formed a And his dad did tie it up, his dad tied it up and sucked the blood out. And they killed it, but they couldn't kill that animal, it was so big, they couldn't kill it. And it bit the kid on the foot. But he only spent about eight days in the hospital and then he was discharged. But after a while he came back and got a horrible rash on his skin. And they came back and took him away. And they said it was one of those. And another man, now, was bitten there a little while ago. Do you remember the relative of the man who sells at the market at the exit of Carmen, Don Marcos, he was the one who reported it.
[00:13:25.280] - Speaker 2
He was left crippled, it bit him down here and they removed all the flesh. The flesh rotted because it was surely rotten by now and it was on the beach.
[00:13:36.280] - Speaker 2
And so it was for many others. Another man up there was bitten, and they took him straight to Ibagué. Suddenly, everyone was leaving at once, without delay. But I had delayed, so I had to walk all the way from there to the highway, on foot. Then it caught up with me. It's not that I already had the poison in my mouth. I don't know how I didn't die, right? Because there was a man living in that little house and I said to him, "Don Julán, a snake bit me." He said, "Run, Mrs. Silvia, because you're going to fall, you're going to fall." Run!" And I ran. And I ran, and then the blood splattered all over me like this. Then, when I got there, I already had this, because I couldn't speak. But nothing hurt. I could feel everything. Everything looked yellow, different, silent, strange, like another world. Yes, it was horrible.
[00:14:32.620] - Speaker 1
I'm so sorry, that's a really bad experience. And I have questions too. So, now, do you know how to prevent or avoid getting bitten?
[00:14:50.270] - Speaker 2
Suddenly, if there's something to tie yourself to, then tie yourself to it. And if not, then run to the doctor.
[00:14:58.760] - Speaker 1
Yes, but before a snake bite, do you know how to avoid snake bites?
[00:15:06.720] - Speaker 2
Avoid them, yes. Be alert, be careful. Yes, be careful that you don't For example, the boy we were looking for to work, he cut that broom and there was a snake, but it was big, he caught it with a stick and cut it into several pieces. And there it was in the broom and someone was picking brooms. Imagine that. And he found two in the broom and I went every day to cut brooms. Well, dangerous? Yes. And then he caught one with his hand, mind you, because it was very hot and since we didn't live here, we lived on the edge of the road, not on the edge of the road, but next to... Just picking them up from a little entrance. And I picked one up with my hand because I had a tin to get water and it was very hot and I decided to bathe my little dog, and I went to get the water and I picked her up. And then I lifted it up like this: "Oh, my God!
[00:16:10.801] - Speaker 2
A snake! I threw the bucket at it and caught it with my hand like this and threw it on the floor. And then they came looking for it and it was gone. And the thing is, it was a big one, it bites and comes back and bites me, because it was going to bite me again.
[00:16:31.150] - Speaker 2
I started looking for it thinking it was a spider, and I almost stepped on it again. And it was like this, and now I'm like this. And my tongue was like this, and it was already stinging again.
[00:16:44.030] - Speaker 1
Twice.
[00:16:45.290] - Speaker 2
Yes, it was going to sting me twice. So, I came over carefully and stepped aside. But it's really awful, because you feel so weak and dizzy. Other than that, yes, and the pain, it hurt a lot, my leg hurt a lot. And now, I'm always on my guard, I go with my friends, I keep an eye out. And now I hardly ever find them, just a few.
[00:17:18.590] - Speaker 1
And where do you feel most likely to be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:17:28.680] - Speaker 2
Anywhere, at home, in the countryside. A friend of mine was bitten at home. Yes, me too. Yes, horrible. She went to the kitchen early in the morning to cook for a young girl. And then, because her mother had been robbed, she was scared and nervous, so she didn't tell her mother. And she left the snake there, and the Chinese woman came back running and there was the snake and she killed it, but without the mother noticing. And it was butterfly-shaped, it had butterflies all over its body, but it was an electric butterfly, how horrible. That's how it was, butterflies like that, all drawn on its body. And it was a snake this thick. That was gross, because they took a photo and showed it to me. And its body was covered in butterflies, as if it had butterflies. Yes, but it was like that, like butterfly tattoos. Yes, that's horrible. And she didn't She went to turn two and also went to the doctor and she didn't get that bad.
[00:18:38.020] - Speaker 2
She kept working, she works at Mundo Mujer. And that's how it is. And are there many who have been bitten like that and not?
[00:18:48.500] - Speaker 2
But when I went there, when they took me there sick, because I was in pain from that sting or that animal bite, they brought out a child, took him away, and he died, because they amputated his leg and he died. The baby was bitten on the leg by a snake, a snake. And they say that the little one is more vicious than the big one, because she hasn't bitten anyone. And suddenly the big one doesn't have as much venom or it's not as strong, but the little one is very vicious.
[00:19:28.990] - Speaker 1
Now do you know how to identify poisonous snakes from non-poisonous ones?
[00:19:35.400] - Speaker 2
Yes, I know what they are. Suddenly, yes, I know size X. They say that the choir Well, his classmates told me that the choir wasn't tough.
[00:19:47.670] - Speaker 1
Coral is fierce But she's not fierce, she's poisonous. Poisonous, yes. But she's not very fierce.
[00:19:54.150] - Speaker 2
There, at the front door, and there at the entrance that leads in here. I was walking by and there was one, but it was really thick and red, all painted black and red, and you wouldn't believe it wouldn't let me pass, but it wasn't pushing me or anything, and it wouldn't let me pass. So I scared her away. I scared her away with a stick and said, "That's how you get, and she left and went away. But she didn't attack me like the others do, because they do attack you. Because I found one too that I had to fix in that apartment building there, and I went to grab the bush, like this, and she was there, ready, and once she got a chance, she attacked me. So I pulled her away with a stick because she was very angry, and she got into a hole. So what I did was I went to Celia like this, and she pulled me away and did this to me.
[00:20:50.399] - Speaker 2
So I said, "Leave her there, don't move," and I brought a big rock and put it on top of her. Then I said to the teacher, "Be careful because we have to kill that snake."
[00:21:02.260] - Speaker 2
He said, "It'll suddenly itch again." I said, "No, because I'm not going back there."
[00:21:10.210] - Speaker 1
And how do you identify different snakes? By their color or their skin?
[00:21:18.430] - Speaker 2
Yes, there are different kinds. There's the green one, they call it bejuca, the yellow one is called toche, the red one is called coral, and the gray one is called sabanera. There are different kinds, because they found one there that was completely white. So strange, isn't it? I've never seen a snake like that before. No, neither have I. All white. And on top of that, I don't know, but they told me it was white, that it's rare. Okay. Yes, horrible. And I've also seen snakes that are thick like dirt, but they also bite. There were some on a farm over there, and someone was going to fix something and saw them in the dirt, and the snakes came out. Thick, thick but short. And there's that one, what do you call it? The one that eats chickens. It runs around, hides, and eats chickens. And there's the hunter too. That one runs too, it doesn't chase you, it just runs.
[00:22:30.435] - Speaker 2
But it's big too and likes to eat chickens. Wherever there are chickens, it eats them, but they haven't come here.
[00:22:39.920] - Speaker 1
Is a boa different from a boba? No. Is it different?
[00:22:44.480] - Speaker 2
Yes, it's excellent, yes.
[00:22:46.650] - Speaker 1
And if you need to go to the hospital again, is that difficult for you or easy?
[00:22:55.160] - Speaker 2
No, when I go to the hospital, I ask the doctors, "Well, what's new?" I tell them, "I was bitten by a snake," and they don't say anything.
[00:23:06.230] - Speaker 1
And do you have a motorcycle to go to the hospital?
[00:23:10.140] - Speaker 2
No, ma'am.
[00:23:11.320] - Speaker 1
Do you have a neighbor?
[00:23:12.630] - Speaker 2
Yes, we called a neighbor. We called a motorcycle taxi. Horita's husband has a car, so we'll go in the car if, God forbid, it's still there. Yes, because that's horrible. Now, what day was it when there was one here, here in the kitchen, there was one like this, right on the counter, asleep. And I said, "My God, a snake." And I moved the rag and she was underneath it. So, I removed it and she was underneath, there on the edge. But she was this big, not that big. She was curled up there. But no, she was asleep, surely. And I killed it because they say you shouldn't kill them. The boy told me not to kill them, to leave them alone because you don't kill them.
[00:23:54.980] - Speaker 1
If they're not poisonous, you don't need to kill them.
[00:23:57.490] - Speaker 2
If it's not poisonous, then yes, I do. I hardly ever Yes, they hardly ever come here. I make bonfires and mud. Sometimes you see thin ones, hamameli, that are very thin, you see them moving like that. But otherwise, dangerous, fierce snakes like that, I haven't seen any.
[00:24:23.680] - Speaker 1
I don't have any more questions, but do you have anything else to say about snakes or your knowledge and experiences with them? No, not at the moment, because I haven't seen any around here.
[00:24:37.580] - Speaker 2
You see more of them here, near the exit, near the house, so you can easily find one if you need to. But around here, hardly ever. Yes, the boy found that one over there in Escobal. Yes, suddenly, her husband was working over there, next to here, next to the Paso. And he killed about 30 rattlesnakes. And that one is fierce, but she warns you. She warns you when it's coming, you hear the rattle. So you say, "Oh, there's a snake around here." And she goes. But if you step on it, it kills you, because it really kills. That snake kills people.
[00:25:19.640] - Speaker 1
Yes, of course. And well, yes, you know, but it's important to help Snake and take him to the hospital afterwards.
[00:25:31.980] - Speaker 2
Yes, ma'am. It's important. Yes, it's important to get one for the hospital right away. Yes, a snake bite kit, yes.
[00:25:38.820] - Speaker 1
And it's important to know which snake bit you. Yes.
[00:25:41.600] - Speaker 2
Sometimes they ask you to carry it.
[00:25:44.100] - Speaker 1
Yes, exactly.
[00:25:44.910] - Speaker 2
If you find it. Yes, exactly. Because sometimes they get lost when you don't Because, for example, size X, she sees it and if she bites it, she stays there and doesn't go away. She stays there waiting for another bite. On the other hand, the coral one, she hides, she goes away or hides. So that's the serious thing. Yes, exactly. Because that's how it is, that X snake chases you, X. And they told me it was rotten now, because it could... It used to do this to me, it would fall on the pieces of meat. And then it healed, two came out right there. In the same place? Ma'am, I have a picture on my cell phone of how it looked. Come on, papi, your cell phone. It's gone. There you go. They're coming up. Ah, look, here they are. Look. And that was from poor circulation. That was the wound I had just now. Horrible, isn't it?
[00:27:18.210] - Speaker 1
Horrible, yes.
[00:27:19.890] - Speaker 2
And that hurts, Holy Virgin, that at night, I cried from the pain. And that, from the poor circulation, from the bite of that animal. But now, thank God, now I have Horrible. And if you see that there's almost nothing left... I put some cream on it and there's almost no scar left. But yes, thank God you're better.
[00:27:44.240] - Speaker 1
Yes, ma'am.
[00:27:44.390] - Speaker 2
Yes, that doctor. And also the herb he made for me. The herb around here is abundant, and the cattle eat it. And you bathe yourself down there, down there, like this. And they say that the poison comes out. I have to do it again, I do it for several days, like nine days, you take a bath. And you crush it raw and rub it on your leg, on the part where it bit you. Yes, it's hot.
[00:28:15.080] - Speaker 1
Yes, ma'am. That's too bad. I'm sorry, it's unfortunate, but thank goodness.
[00:28:20.250] - Speaker 2
Yes, ma'am.
[00:28:21.140] - Speaker 1
You look better. But thank you very much. I don't have any more. But you're very kind. Yes, ma'am. And thank you very much for your time.
[00:28:28.640] - Speaker 2
I'm glad you came. I think it's good that people are paying attention.
[00:28:34.640] - Speaker 1
Yes, it is important. Your story is very important.
[00:28:37.360] - Speaker 2
Yes, because you never know when it might happen. You're out at night, walking around. So you know you have to get to the hospital quickly.
[00:28:47.770] - Speaker 1
Exactly, it's important because there are people who don't know, it's important to get it right.
[00:28:52.930] - Speaker 2
No, that's okay. That's okay, because it doesn't hurt, but then it builds up because it spreads through your body and then you start to feel weak because all the poison is in your blood. That happened to me too, I put it on and went running and got bitten. Then the poison mixed with my blood.
[00:29:15.660] - Speaker 1
Yes, exactly.
[00:29:16.530] - Speaker 2
And that's why it spread to my lung and kidney. And they did dialysis on me, nine dialysis sessions.
[00:29:24.910] - Speaker 1
Really?
[00:29:26.050] - Speaker 2
Yes, they did nine dialysis treatments. And on the last one, it didn't work anymore, because the machine wouldn't accept it. So they had to take me off and stop, because it wasn't working anymore, the machine stopped and my blood wasn't circulating. I don't know why. And I went into shock. I went into shock, my daughter was with me and I lost consciousness. And they came back and took me and put alcohol on me and all that, and they weighed me and did things to me again. Yes, I spent a long time in the hospital.

[00:30:22.270] - Speaker 2
No, no, no, no, it wasn't that expensive because I have health insurance through the town, yes. So, they treated me with that.
