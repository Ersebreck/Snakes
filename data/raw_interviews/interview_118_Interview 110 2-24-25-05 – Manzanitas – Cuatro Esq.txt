I'm coming over now.
[00:00:24.860] - Speaker 2
Okay. So, do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:30.680] - Speaker 1
Yes, of course, there's a chest here.
[00:00:32.030] - Speaker 2
Why?
[00:00:33.330] - Speaker 1
Because there are a lot of them around here They're called tallas, and they're the ones that bite people the most. Have any of your animals been bitten by a snake?
[00:00:45.560] - Speaker 2
No.
[00:00:46.460] - Speaker 1
A guy I knew, a long time ago, was killed by a carving.
[00:00:49.630] - Speaker 2
But an animal that belongs to you, like a pet or livestock, right?
[00:00:54.010] - Speaker 1
He won, yes. Now that I think about it, he beat me for about two years up there.
[00:00:59.810] - Speaker 2
And he died.
[00:01:02.280] - Speaker 1
Yes.
[00:01:04.920] - Speaker 2
And do you know how to prevent or avoid a snake bite? What would you do if you were bitten by a snake?
[00:01:14.240] - Speaker 1
They say that the most shameful thing to do is to kill her and take the snake part to the hospital so they can give it to the patient.
[00:01:27.490] - Speaker 2
Would you trust the hospital in Carmen to treat a snake bite?
[00:01:31.190] - Speaker 1
Now they have the serum there.
[00:01:35.860] - Speaker 2
And do you consult other hospitals as well to treat a snake bite?
[00:01:40.770] - Speaker 1
I think so.
[00:01:41.850] - Speaker 2
And if you need to go to the hospital, is that difficult for you or easy?
[00:01:48.210] - Speaker 1
No, because the poison spreads as you panic. Because it's not flat out there, out there you'll get bitten by a snake in the morning and in the afternoon they'll go there, they don't do anything to you there. Over there, they say a prayer and use a plant called Guayacana, which they call ventiaguja. They make a braid with water and a prayer, and that's what they use to encourage them on the plains.
[00:02:18.150] - Speaker 2
And where do you feel most likely to be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:02:26.580] - Speaker 1
Well, more likely in the countryside. Why? Because they camouflage themselves with the leaves. And you're walking along and when you lose them, you step on them.
[00:02:37.490] - Speaker 2
And do you know how to identify poisonous snakes or snakes that cause nine days of pain? How? Do you know how to identify poisonous snakes or snakes that cause nine days of pain?
[00:02:45.810] - Speaker 1
Around here, the most common is size X. There's also the cat hair, which is whiter than the X. The X is kind of black. And the cat hair is white, but it also has the same X, yes. And then there's the... Well, the coral one isn't very common around here, but it also bites. And which one is that? There's the cool one, which is green underneath, sort of semi-green, and blackish on top. Those are the three I know best.
[00:03:29.060] - Speaker 2
Okay.
[00:03:30.130] - Speaker 1
They are the most commonly mentioned ones.
[00:03:33.440] - Speaker 2
And do you know of any cases of snake bites?
[00:03:36.600] - Speaker 1
Not here. A boy upstairs, Felipe, when he bit him, he got tangled up and bit him here. He was in the hospital. He went to the hospital. Yes, and when he arrived, he was vomiting, you didn't see him when he first He was just skin and bones.
[00:03:54.650] - Speaker 2
And that's the only case I know of around here. Well, I don't have any more questions, but do you have anything else to say about snakes or your knowledge, anything else?
[00:04:07.840] - Speaker 1
I can more or less tell the difference between the fierce ones and the non-fierce ones. Sure. At least that one isn't fierce, because if you whip it, it likes to be whipped. And those pants hanging down like that hang from the tail and catch like that. And the mitados, but the mitados aren't fierce.
[00:04:27.380] - Speaker 2
And it's important. Look, after a snake bite, you need to go straight to the hospital. To the hospital, yes. And you know, but you need to know what kind of snake bit you, and you can kill it and take it to the hospital.
[00:04:43.100] - Speaker 1
Take her to the hospital, yes. Exactly.
[00:04:45.470] - Speaker 2
Or take a photo.
[00:04:46.720] - Speaker 1
A photo, yes. Yes, that's right, more or less one here, when you go out into the field, you have to watch where you put your feet. Often, when you go there, they camouflage themselves with leaves. So, whenever I go out into the field, I always watch where I put my feet.
[00:05:03.910] - Speaker 2
It's important to look carefully, yes. Thank you very much. Well, thank you. All right.
[00:05:09.450] - Speaker 1
Thanks, Tulio.
