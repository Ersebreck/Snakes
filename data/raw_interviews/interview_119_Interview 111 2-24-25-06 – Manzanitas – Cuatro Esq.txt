So, do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:53.200] - Speaker 1
Here, in these places, near the ravines, you have to walk very carefully. Be careful. Yes. Right now in winter, you have to be very careful when you go out, when the ravine rises, it's even worse. There are a lot of snakes. Of course. And they leave them on the bank. Of course. So you have to wear boots, good footwear.
[00:01:20.550] - Speaker 2
Yes. And do you know how to prevent or avoid a snake bite? With boots.
[00:01:28.250] - Speaker 1
Avoid it, footwear, limit.
[00:01:32.000] - Speaker 2
Exactly.
[00:01:32.990] - Speaker 1
Because the boots hardly come off either. No, they don't. Or you step on a big pile and it gets transferred to the other one. So you have to be careful where you put your feet.
[00:01:48.130] - Speaker 2
Sure, yes. And have any of your animals or livestock been bitten by a snake?
[00:01:58.280] - Speaker 1
My father-in-law was called a snake. He stabbed him in the mouth and rushed him to the hospital.
[00:02:12.740] - Speaker 2
And what would you do if a snake bit you?
[00:02:18.870] - Speaker 1
Well, here in this place, if you see one, you probably have to kill the snake to help it, because there are cases where you go and say, "No, I think it bit me, but what if it's not the right kind?" They give you antibiotics for another snake and you get sick. Exactly. So, you have to grab it and go straight to Gilardo, because there's no meat here, that's how it is. This hospital is like a health center, that's why we tell them to ask for pills. It's not bad.
[00:03:04.560] - Speaker 2
And if you need to go to the hospital, is that difficult for you or easy?
[00:03:12.450] - Speaker 1
Not at the moment. It's easy, but it can
[00:03:16.220] - Speaker 2
You have a motorcycle. You have a motorcycle. Okay, good.
[00:03:19.650] - Speaker 1
It moves me quickly.
[00:03:21.040] - Speaker 2
Okay, good. And where do you feel most likely to be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:03:31.480] - Speaker 1
In the countryside. Here, at this time of year, snakes get right under my skin. So you have to be on your guard. When you go to bed, they can come back in two hours and bite you, so you have to be careful, because I've found them there in that corridor, I've found them. So you have to be very careful.
[00:03:55.840] - Speaker 2
Sure. And do you know how to identify poisonous and non-poisonous snakes?
[00:04:06.040] - Speaker 1
Yes, of course. Everyone knows the hunting snake, which isn't poisonous. That's what it does, it eats frogs, mice, and digs. Do you know the other snake, the guío? The guío eats chickens and eggs. Yes, it bites, but it's not poisonous. It's not poisonous. It's not poisonous.
[00:04:40.530] - Speaker 2
And how do you identify snakes? By their color, their skin, their Their color.
[00:04:47.640] - Speaker 1
The carving has a color that That one has the X. The coral one too. Almost. In this place, carvings are the most common. Occasionally you find a coral one, every now and then.
[00:05:16.410] - Speaker 2
And do you know of any cases of snake bites?
[00:05:24.190] - Speaker 1
There have been several cases here. Not here, but there have been several cases, like three or four, that weren't fatal. It was the same thing, which is that sometimes people What happens is that if they get bitten by a female, you touch... You realize that nothing has happened, because your nerves make the poison run faster. So, from here, I start to panic, because I have to get there in 15 minutes to turn everything around, or I'll die. What I mean is... So, I arrived dying. You go from being calm to... I'm not carrying anything, it'll be fine, it'll be smooth sailing.
[00:06:24.710] - Speaker 2
Yes, thank you. I don't have any more questions, but if you have anything else to say about snakes, if you have more knowledge about snakes or anything else to add.
[00:06:38.450] - Speaker 1
No, the only good thing is that it's good that we have antibiotics here in Carmen so we don't have to go all the way to Gilardón. Of course. Not even the people.
[00:06:58.450] - Speaker 2
Yes.
[00:07:00.100] - Speaker 1
I will conclude this interview now, Jorge Reyes, who spoke with you. Yes. A journalist, there you see.
[00:07:09.570] - Speaker 2
Well, the most important information is that after a snake bite, it is important to go straight to the hospital. To the hospital, yes. And it is important to know what kind of snake bit you, because there are different antivenoms for different snakes. Yes. Can you take a picture of the snake or can you kill it and take it to the hospital?
[00:07:36.220] - Speaker 1
Take her to the hospital, because there was a case here. Juan Herrán's brother. He was stung by a scorpion and went to the hospital. There they said it was a snake. They applied the old snake remedy. When they had applied it, he said no, it was a scorpion, now you dance, there was nothing to be done. Is the youngest one there? He's so young. That's why, when that happens, you have to kill the snake right away. This is the snake that stung me. And of course, if you applied a cut, they'll give you that antibiotic from the corral. That makes you look bad, really bad.
[00:08:48.370] - Speaker 2
Yes. But yes, thank you very much for your time. That's all I have, I'm ready. Well, ma'am. Thank you very much, you're very kind.
