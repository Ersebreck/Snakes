[00:00:44.110] - Speaker 4
Fourteen years.
[00:00:47.110] - Speaker 2
So, do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:51.810] - Speaker 4
Yes.
[00:00:52.810] - Speaker 2
Why?
[00:00:54.040] - Speaker 4
Because they're out and about. They mostly go out at night, after five in the afternoon.
[00:01:04.590] - Speaker 2
Have any of your animals been bitten by a snake, such as livestock or pets?
[00:01:12.320] - Speaker 4
No. Sometimes chickens.
[00:01:14.080] - Speaker 2
And do you know how to prevent or avoid a snake bite?
[00:01:24.520] - Speaker 1
What about?
[00:01:27.690] - Speaker 2
Do you know how to prevent or avoid a snake bite? No.
[00:01:31.380] - Speaker 1
I don't know. You said you would eat the burrito.
[00:01:39.050] - Speaker 2
What would you do if you were bitten by a snake?
[00:01:42.150] - Speaker 1
I believe it helps prevent the poison from spreading. There are people who take borugo there, and often they don't even need to go to the doctor.
[00:01:57.130] - Speaker 3
I'm not going to the doctor or anything, but take some of those. Because Marina, my sister, they prepared that borujo for her and she said, "If I'm going to take that, I'd rather take more poison that I don't know about." So she said, "No, they prepared that for me, I have to take it because otherwise I'll die, because it's strong, it's poisonous." So they saw that. Then I got the urge, I got the urge right there. Me, for example, wherever I see one, I kill it. Yes. Because why leave one alive, it might get inside you or bite you, that's dangerous.
[00:02:42.700] - Speaker 2
Sure.
[00:02:44.050] - Speaker 1
But around here, hardly any. And they don't come here? Okay. In the pasture, over there, you can see a lot right now; it's been dug up from there.
[00:02:51.220] - Speaker 2
Yes.
[00:02:52.730] - Speaker 1
Because I'm almost there now, it's almost there, I can hardly see it from here.
[00:02:59.360] - Speaker 2
But would you go to the hospital after a heartbreak that makes you cry?
[00:03:04.440] - Speaker 1
Yes, of course. But here, thank God, never.
[00:03:07.570] - Speaker 2
Well, yes. It's never happened to us, only to others, and it never will. Thank God, yes.
[00:03:12.660] - Speaker 3
I don't know if I'm afraid of them, but I don't love them that much either. Because they're dangerous for us. They need to give us that. And I was born, because when you see us, you remember that they beat up the hero, because they beat up the hero. His father was bitten by a snake.
[00:03:37.140] - Speaker 2
Once on the bear?
[00:03:38.150] - Speaker 1
My dad was bitten by a snake, but that was many years ago. But he also Nothing happened. I don't know, back then there weren't any hooks or anything.
[00:03:50.690] - Speaker 3
He didn't even go to the doctor; he didn't want to go, but there was one of those plants You know the ones, the ones with the snake-like leaves that look like a bush of thorns.
[00:04:01.470] - Speaker 1
It looks like a mother-in-law's tongue now.
[00:04:05.460] - Speaker 3
And then there, he told me to boil some water for him to drink and wash his foot. I did that for him; there was nothing else we could do. But we've also seen people We have some friends here who have a little girl who killed a snake.
[00:04:31.310] - Speaker 2
That's too bad.
[00:04:34.560] - Speaker 1
But snakes seem to go after women more than men. I see more women getting bitten than men. For example, in Luzvilla, there was a girl, Aliris' daughter, and then the woman from Granario, she was also a woman. The one who died upstairs, that woman, a woman. I see that snakes mostly bite women.
[00:05:04.700] - Speaker 3
Interesting The one who has been around spends more time in the mountains, but I don't know. Right?
[00:05:15.940] - Speaker 2
Interesting. And if you need to go to the hospital, is that difficult or easy for you?
[00:05:25.290] - Speaker 1
Sure, I do think it's better to go to the hospital.
[00:05:29.090] - Speaker 4
Sure, it's time to go, because the poison is spreading.
[00:05:34.980] - Speaker 2
Yes, but if you need to go, is it difficult to get to the hospital, or is it easy? Do you have transportation, do you have a motorcycle?
[00:05:43.310] - Speaker 4
No, if you don't have a motorcycle, Mayor, it's your turn.
[00:05:45.970] - Speaker 2
That's a bit harsh. Would you go to the hospital in El Carmen if you were dying in El Carmen?
[00:05:56.920] - Speaker 1
No, not urgent, Carmen and the rest in Gilardón.
[00:06:02.320] - Speaker 2
Would you trust the hospital in Carmen to heal you?
[00:06:04.870] - Speaker 1
El Carmen isn't even a first-rate hospital; it's barely adequate for emergencies. So you'd have to go to a better hospital. And they can't get the serum, the serum I told him that on the Gilardón side.
[00:06:17.630] - Speaker 2
And where do you feel you are most likely to be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:06:27.660] - Speaker 4
In the countryside.
[00:06:30.460] - Speaker 1
Why? No, I think Creole women look for more in a home, I believe.
[00:06:35.810] - Speaker 2
The house and the countryside. Why do you think the countryside is more dangerous?
[00:06:40.000] - Speaker 4
Because there is a lot of scrubland and it is practically like a jungle. On the other hand, in the house, if an animal comes in, you can kill it or scare it away. But if you suddenly go to the shore where you like to go and one of those animals appears, is that right?
[00:06:58.410] - Speaker 2
Yes. Like you believe in the house.
[00:07:01.240] - Speaker 1
When it's raining, they look for houses a lot when it's raining.
[00:07:05.640] - Speaker 2
Also, can you identify whether snakes are poisonous or non-poisonous?
[00:07:14.350] - Speaker 4
Around here? I don't know.
[00:07:16.910] - Speaker 1
Which ones?
[00:07:18.210] - Speaker 2
Yes, you know how to identify snakes.
[00:07:21.240] - Speaker 1
Well, I know one that was called talla, talla molán.
[00:07:25.550] - Speaker 4
He does, because he spends his time in the countryside and he knows what it's like.
[00:07:28.990] - Speaker 1
La Taya Molán And carve And the chili pepper tail, here, the part that sticks out the most, and vines, because those two are dangerous. Carve an X, that X.
[00:07:37.590] - Speaker 3
Size X agrees that
[00:07:40.670] - Speaker 1
I see those, right? The most common ones, right? The molded ones and the little ones that are floating around, which are kind of yellow and have an X shape, but they're yellow, not really size X. And there's a lot of Y here. Really? And coral too, on this side. I see a lot.
[00:08:08.070] - Speaker 2
And do you know of a case of snake bite? Yes, your father?
[00:08:16.320] - Speaker 1
Yes, but my dad has been doing it for many years, more than 50 years, imagine that.
[00:08:21.920] - Speaker 2
And nothing happened with the snake. No. Do you know of any other cases of snake bites?
[00:08:28.280] - Speaker 1
Around here, among the people, the neighbors, yes, a girl was walking along the road and was bitten by a snake. I don't know what kind of snake it was.
[00:08:38.660] - Speaker 3
But if nothing else, they were only going to cut off his foot. And it was like a bench.
[00:08:46.220] - Speaker 1
Yes, I think so
[00:08:48.810] - Speaker 2
Yes.
[00:08:49.770] - Speaker 1
They say there's rot there, so I don't touch it, the rot. Not even a little? No.
[00:09:00.720] - Speaker 2
Okay.
[00:09:01.290] - Speaker 3
Once I was walking through their land, the ravine they had dug, and I was leading a cow down to graze. And when one Or actually, that's how I told the story. So, I grabbed a stick, killed it, and buried it. Because I don't like leaving animals lying around. Can you see that or not?
[00:09:28.580] - Speaker 2
No. Well, I don't have any more questions. Do you have anything else to say about snakes or your knowledge of snakes or anything else? No. And the most important information is that after a snake bite, you need to go straight to the hospital. And it's important to know what kind of snake bit you, because there are different antivenoms for different snakes. And you can take a picture of the snake or you can kill it and take it to the hospital. And that's more important.
[00:10:05.740] - Speaker 4
But yes, thank you very much.
[00:10:09.840] - Speaker 2
That's all I have. Thank you very much. You're very kind.
[00:10:13.880] - Speaker 4
And where are you from?
