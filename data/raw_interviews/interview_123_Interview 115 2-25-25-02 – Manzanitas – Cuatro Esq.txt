Interview 115 2-25-25-02 – Manzanitas – Cuatro Esquinas
[00:00:00.850] - Speaker 2
And what is your name? Amparo Rodríguez. And do you agree to be recorded and interviewed?
[00:00:14.750] - Speaker 3
Yes, of course. How old are you?
[00:00:17.850] - Speaker 2
65.
[00:00:19.680] - Speaker 3
And what do you do for a living? If you work?
[00:00:21.990] - Speaker 2
Right now, here I am, at home.
[00:00:26.560] - Speaker 3
Are you married or single?
[00:00:29.510] - Speaker 2
Separated.
[00:00:30.760] - Speaker 3
Do you have children?
[00:00:32.550] - Speaker 2
Two children, yes, sir.
[00:00:34.450] - Speaker 3
And how many years have you lived in Carmen?
[00:00:37.270] - Speaker 2
I left for Bogotá when I was very young and came back five years ago. I'm settled here now, yes. I lived in Bogotá for the rest of the time.
[00:00:50.100] - Speaker 3
So, do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:57.000] - Speaker 2
Bite me?
[00:00:59.830] - Speaker 3
No, do you think it's likely that a snake will bite you here? It's a possibility.
[00:01:07.190] - Speaker 2
Yes, of course.
[00:01:07.960] - Speaker 3
Okay. Why?
[00:01:09.690] - Speaker 2
Because sometimes they hide in houses or in the stubble. And suddenly, anyway, you move around, let's say, from here to there, and you step on her, and suddenly you step on her, and she bites.
[00:01:29.710] - Speaker 3
Right? Right, yes. And have any of your animals been bitten by a snake, such as a pet, a dog, or livestock?
[00:01:41.660] - Speaker 2
No, no, sir.
[00:01:44.200] - Speaker 3
And do you know how they prevented a snake bite? No.
[00:01:50.530] - Speaker 2
Absolutely.
[00:01:51.600] - Speaker 3
No problem.
[00:01:53.550] - Speaker 2
But I am very afraid of it.
[00:01:55.590] - Speaker 3
Sure, yeah. It's horrible, yeah. Yeah, it's horrible. What would you do if a snake bit you?
[00:02:01.210] - Speaker 2
I don't know. Well, I don't know, honestly, one doesn't know how to deal with that.
[00:02:10.140] - Speaker 3
Would you go to the hospital after a bite? Yes, of course. Which hospital?
[00:02:17.660] - Speaker 2
The closest one is Carmen.
[00:02:21.310] - Speaker 3
And would you trust the hospital, in Carmen, to cure a snake bite?
[00:02:27.340] - Speaker 2
Well, I don't think there's a quick solution. But then, once you're there, they transfer you to another hospital, let's say the closest one, which is Girardot or Melgar. I don't know if they'll treat that emergency in Melgar, right? Or you knock on the door and who knows what happens. To be honest, thank God, I've never had any experience with that, not in my family or anything. Thank God. But I have heard that there have been people around here who have been bitten. Of course.
[00:03:06.140] - Speaker 3
And if you need to go to the hospital, is that difficult for you or easy?
[00:03:12.260] - Speaker 2
It's always difficult.
[00:03:14.110] - Speaker 3
Why?
[00:03:15.020] - Speaker 2
Because, let's say, I don't have a means of transportation available, and it would be up to someone else to call and pick me up so I can get to Y tal, by some means of transportation.
[00:03:33.510] - Speaker 3
And where do you feel most likely to be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:03:41.870] - Speaker 2
I think outside. In the open area. Because they don't usually go inside the house As long as the houses are inhabited, because people fumigate and use detergent and all that stuff, which they say, I don't know if it's true, bothers them. So, I once found one inside, but it was really small. And my cats, the cats I have as pets, they bring snakes and play with them and kill them.
[00:04:28.280] - Speaker 3
And do you know how to identify poisonous snakes from non-poisonous ones? No. It's difficult. And do you know of any cases of snake bites resulting in death?
[00:04:39.690] - Speaker 2
Your wife's? Luzmina? Yes, his wife. I was told. I didn't see how they identified it as a snake or anything.
[00:04:53.140] - Speaker 1
For the colors.
[00:04:57.500] - Speaker 2
No, but when you bite it, let's say at night when you can't see it, right?
[00:05:04.560] - Speaker 3
Yes, because it's dark and difficult to see.
[00:05:07.710] - Speaker 2
Sure, yes. So, I've always been afraid of that, of not walking at night in places where you know there are leaves or something you can't see. But then, in the case that I think that suddenly I'm walking and I step on it and it bites me, and if I don't see it, I'm left wondering, was it a snake that bit me? How can I know?
[00:05:35.250] - Speaker 3
Yes, yes, it's a problem.
[00:05:36.860] - Speaker 2
Was it a snake bite? Exactly, that's a problem. I don't know, how did they let him go?
[00:05:44.310] - Speaker 1
I've always left two gaps, but you'll see which ones.
[00:05:49.440] - Speaker 2
Exactly, yes. Well, that's more difficult, isn't it?
[00:05:51.960] - Speaker 1
In Luz Milla's case, she killed her.
[00:05:54.840] - Speaker 2
Exactly, because there are people who see it, let's say, if it's daytime and I step on it, I see it, right? But at night, let's say you leave here and go somewhere else, it could happen.
[00:06:09.860] - Speaker 1
The poisonous one always bites one person and then turns on the other. Right? She doesn't run away.
[00:06:16.280] - Speaker 2
Oh, my God!
[00:06:17.660] - Speaker 1
Because that's why the snake bit her and killed her. Yes, because Because she stepped on it on the bare cement floor as she was leaving the kitchen. She stepped on it, and it was there, leaning against the wall, ready to strike. Oh, my God! There's a stick over there. She picked it up and...
[00:06:31.280] - Speaker 2
I thought she would bite and run away.
[00:06:33.400] - Speaker 1
No, the poisonous one gets angry and stays there waiting for something bad to happen.
[00:06:38.880] - Speaker 2
Oh, God. And how does one know it's poisonous? I mean, aren't all snakes poisonous?
[00:06:46.280] - Speaker 3
No, not all snakes are poisonous. There are different ways to identify poisonous snakes, by their color, their fangs, their skin, their head. But I'm not an expert on snakes, I'm a public health researcher. But important information after a snake bite is important, and the right to go to the hospital. And it's important to know what kind of snake bit you, because there are different antivenoms for different snakes. You can take a picture of the snake or you can kill it and take it to the hospital. And that's important, because yes. But yes, not all snakes are poisonous. Here, the X-ray snakes, coral snakes, and rattlesnakes are the poisonous snakes.
[00:08:02.770] - Speaker 2
Is this from the Andean climate?
[00:08:07.160] - Speaker 3
This is where the snakes are. There are other poisonous snakes in the jungle, but in this part it's
[00:08:23.570] - Speaker 2
Those three.
[00:08:24.400] - Speaker 3
Yes.
[00:08:26.480] - Speaker 2
The size X and Cascahuelo. Cascahuelo. Cascahuelo. Cascabel and The choir. Choir. And they're all different colors, right? Yes. Which one is the dark brown one? The size?
[00:08:42.130] - Speaker 3
The size. And the corals are red and white and black. And the cascabelles are easy to identify because they have a On the tail.
[00:08:56.300] - Speaker 2
In the queue, yes. A maraca.
[00:08:57.990] - Speaker 3
A maraca on your tail, yes.
[00:08:59.670] - Speaker 2
But normally, you hardly ever see them around here.
[00:09:02.860] - Speaker 3
There aren't many in that area because it's wetter here. They use the dry ones.
[00:09:11.810] - Speaker 2
Like More rocks or something?
[00:09:15.940] - Speaker 3
I think so, yes. The hill? Yes, I think so. But yes, I hope you don't have a snake bite. But yes, I don't have any more questions. And how do you prevent them from coming near the house? It's important, it's difficult, but it's important to keep a close eye on them at night. At night you need to have a flashlight, all the time, because there are a lot of snakes in the grass and in the house too. Sure. And it's important to wear boots when you walk in the In the grass. In the grass, yes.
[00:10:05.020] - Speaker 2
No, I walk a little bit.
[00:10:06.920] - Speaker 3
And I don't know if that's a method of prevention, but people here use cryoline or Cryoline.
[00:10:22.350] - Speaker 2
Yes. Fumigal, with cryolene.
[00:10:25.170] - Speaker 3
I don't know if that's currently a method of prevention, but maybe it is.
[00:10:30.810] - Speaker 2
Yes, they suddenly chase them away. They also say that the smell of chlorine and all those chemicals.
[00:10:39.260] - Speaker 3
But the most important thing is Look carefully. Snakes really like trash, so it's important to clean your house, because snakes can hide in spaces with lots of stuff. And that's like Luz Milla's snake. I think the snake was in the trash outside.
[00:11:08.590] - Speaker 1
He went out to the kitchen and a few bricks fell out from underneath. She came out onto the floor and didn't see him.
[00:11:16.430] - Speaker 2
No, yes, they say you have to prevent that, there are holes in there. I have to cover all those holes in that thing, because I need them for
[00:11:26.870] - Speaker 1
Are they hiding that over there?
[00:11:28.830] - Speaker 2
Yes, they hide in there. I once had some of those hollow bricks piled up back here, and I went to pick up a brick, to move one of those bricks, and one came out. Yes, that's right. Yes, some men were working here, and I said, "Oh, my God, a snake!" And they came and killed it. But I don't even know what kind of snake it was, but it was so small. But the thing is But it bites.
[00:11:57.840] - Speaker 1
Even if it's small, but poisonous, send it to the clinic.
[00:12:02.340] - Speaker 2
Holy Father.
[00:12:04.730] - Speaker 1
Maybe it was something like that that stung her. Right? And you didn't take her to the clinic right away.
[00:12:09.760] - Speaker 2
And it lasted a long time, right? And it lasted a day's trip there. To recover. Yes. And what did she do right away?
[00:12:17.190] - Speaker 1
The first thing she did was look to see what it was, and she saw that it was a snake, so she got scared and killed it with a stick.
[00:12:24.230] - Speaker 2
And right away
[00:12:24.630] - Speaker 1
And then they called me, since the bosses were there, they called me, and I went. Since it was nighttime, I couldn't see the Xs very well, because the X is marked with the sign X on the back, just X on top. But it was nighttime and it was a baby, so it wasn't easy to see. So, what did I do? To find out if it was poisonous, I picked it up, opened it with two young broomsticks, opened its mouth and did this, so that they could remove the top part. Yes? That's where the honey mushrooms are, two of them. I did this And with the stick, and there came out the two little spots. I said: It's a Julia, it was poisonous, because the ones that aren't poisonous don't have those honeycombs.
[00:13:07.760] - Speaker 2
Well, in the meantime, who took care of her?
[00:13:09.940] - Speaker 1
No, we took it out immediately.
[00:13:13.290] - Speaker 2
We were bosses there. But all that time, until you went to look at what it was, how it was. But that was quick. And you don't tie your foot or anything. No, that's not good. I mean, I understood that, that they used to do it that way. No, it's not good.
[00:13:28.470] - Speaker 3
It is not recommended. Why? No.
[00:13:30.500] - Speaker 2
Why?
[00:13:31.850] - Speaker 3
Because blood needs to circulate in your body, and you can ask for a leg or an arm.
[00:13:42.500] - Speaker 1
If you twist your leg where you were bitten, you could easily lose your leg. Why? Because the poison didn't spread through your bloodstream, but stayed there and rotted the tissue in your leg.
[00:13:55.380] - Speaker 2
Yes, he ruined him, sir. Protect him. Every day I pray to God that I won't run into them. You can see them, but as long as you don't bother them, that's what I've heard, I don't know if it's true.
[00:14:08.860] - Speaker 3
Yes, snakes are
[00:14:10.180] - Speaker 2
They don't attack you unless you attack them, right? Or step on them or something.
[00:14:17.250] - Speaker 3
Yes, they don't want to attack.
[00:14:19.580] - Speaker 2
Exactly.
[00:14:20.900] - Speaker 3
But if you pice, you pice him. Right?
[00:14:26.130] - Speaker 1
The pizza.
[00:14:26.800] - Speaker 3
If a snake steps on it, it will attack.
[00:14:30.590] - Speaker 2
It's your defense.
[00:14:32.100] - Speaker 3
Exactly.
[00:14:32.440] - Speaker 2
It's like when you step on a cat or a dog, their teeth just go for you, right? Yes, exactly. Well, I don't know. Thank God, here they don't I mean, they also say that cats scare away other pets. Yes, that's true. I don't know. I have four cats, and they're the ones who take care of me.
[00:14:56.570] - Speaker 1
But I did once, yes. And they kill them. But not like that.
[00:14:59.160] - Speaker 2
They kill them.
[00:14:59.440] - Speaker 1
But a small one. A big one
[00:15:01.810] - Speaker 2
Big doesn't kill it.  A cat won't fight it.
[00:15:04.640] - Speaker 1
Right? You don't fight it, because it's big, fast, and throws hard. Between the cat's paws, it's short, and the snake doesn't tire of catching it. And cats know. They know who they can fight.
[00:15:19.740] - Speaker 2
I don't even like you mentioning snakes. I dream about those animals.
[00:15:26.960] - Speaker 3
No, yes. They are dangerous. Of course, yes. But if you know how to look out at night and if you get bitten and go to the hospital, nothing will happen.
[00:15:49.030] - Speaker 2
It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. And how long can one last? I mean, the attention that has been given.
[00:15:59.100] - Speaker 3
At the hospital?
[00:16:00.300] - Speaker 2
No, in terms of getting there, let's say. How long can one last with that bite? About 6 hours, 12 hours. 12 hours, more or less. Here? And nothing happens? No.
[00:16:15.130] - Speaker 3
But you need to go straight there, because there's a good chance. You'll have to wait a long time at the hospital.
[00:16:27.600] - Speaker 1
The paperwork and everything. The referral, if there isn't one to send to the other side.
[00:16:34.680] - Speaker 2
And in the meantime, what are they doing to him?
[00:16:35.740] - Speaker 1
Meanwhile, time passes and it does nothing, because it's just the antacid serum.
[00:16:41.670] - Speaker 2
And there in Carmen, they don't keep up with things.
[00:16:43.060] - Speaker 1
Sometimes they have it, sometimes they don't
[00:16:44.570] - Speaker 3
You understand me, right?
[00:16:46.390] - Speaker 2
Oh, you have to give me a round of applause for that!
[00:16:49.400] - Speaker 3
We have understood each other well.
[00:16:52.720] - Speaker 2
What's that, Mango? He didn't say we wanted Thank you.
[00:16:56.480] - Speaker 3
But yes, in some cases, I have heard about snake bites. Usually, they had a snake bite. Then, up to 12 hours later, they get the antivenom. Yes, of course. Because they go to the hospital and wait a long time. Then they need to go to another hospital and wait again. Then they get the antivenom. Sometimes it can take 12 hours to get the antivenom. It's important to go straight to the hospital afterwards.
[00:17:45.580] - Speaker 2
And let's say that nothing can be done to ensure that the hospital always has that antidote.
[00:17:54.920] - Speaker 3
Not always. In Carmen, sometimes they have anti-physiological drugs, but sometimes they don't, not always. And yes, there are different levels, obviously, of hospitals. And Girardot, Medgar, Espinal, and Baguet are higher level. On another level, yes.
[00:18:21.560] - Speaker 1
Spinal and turning are almost always understood.
[00:18:23.340] - Speaker 3
Almost always, yes.
[00:18:24.540] - Speaker 2
But we, the people who live around here, had to ask. But you already asked, what could be done? I mean, right then and there, what could be done? Go to the hospital. Oh, my God! I'm asking how much time you have to get there, so the poison doesn't kill you. It depends on the surgery. Well, she said 12 hours, but you're not going to wait 12 hours sitting here, you have to go and sort it out. And you have to catch the snake and take it to find out when it is. Exactly, yes. Imagine, a snake bites you and you catch it. Oh, no.
[00:19:01.550] - Speaker 3
Oh my God.
[00:19:03.040] - Speaker 2
Please tell them not to say anything here. No, because I'd rather die than let them die. Just seeing them makes me scream. But yes, we shouldn't bother them, right?
[00:19:15.160] - Speaker 3
That's right.
[00:19:15.920] - Speaker 2
Because last time a snake slithered down here. Yes, that's right. I said to it, "Goodbye, little snake." Is that how you do it? And what do you do for a living? Well, how nice of you to come by. Right on cue.
[00:19:30.760] - Speaker 3
Thank you very much for your time.
[00:19:33.030] - Speaker 2
Well, like.
