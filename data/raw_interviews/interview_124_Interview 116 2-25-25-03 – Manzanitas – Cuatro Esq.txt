No, in the countryside.
[00:02:17.620] - Speaker 1

One came over here to the farm and the other one bit him on the other side.
[00:03:19.620] - Speaker 1
Really? Here? Yes. Well, I don't have any more questions, but do you have anything else to say about snakes or your knowledge of snakes or anything else? No, but I always do this, do you understand? Okay. And it's important to know that after a snake bite, it's important to go straight to the hospital. And it's important to know what kind of snake bit you, because there are different antivenoms for different snakes. And you can take a picture of the snake or you can kill it and take it to the hospital. And yes, that's the important information. But yes, I don't have anything else. Thank you very much for your time.
