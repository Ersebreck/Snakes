Interview 116 2-25-25-03 – con’t - Manzanitas – Cuatro Esquinas
[00:00:00.000] - Speaker 3
Yes, yes.
[00:00:01.550] - Speaker 1
You already interviewed him. Yes, he showed us everything.
[00:00:04.870] - Speaker 3
A very ugly case.
[00:00:05.910] - Speaker 1
All the bites, all the photos he has.
[00:00:07.400] - Speaker 2
No, today the cow bit him. Look, the cow bit him here as he was passing by the farm. Up there, where they have the pasture, they communicate with each other, that is, the cattle came to drink there, and there, about 50 meters away. When it bit him, it
[00:00:22.190] - Speaker 1
Sure, if it was a small animal.
[00:00:24.400] - Speaker 2
Very large carab. Javier is telling the story of a pure miracle of God. He's recovered now, right? But he was, to put it mildly, very
[00:00:33.290] - Speaker 3
He still can't work either.
[00:00:35.760] - Speaker 1
No, what are you talking about? It's going to be a year that bit him and he can't work. No, what are you talking about? He killed him too, the turnstile. Yes. According to Clara's colleagues, they say that the turnstile is no good. It's useless. It's no good. It used to be worse, but now it's even worse.
[00:00:54.710] - Speaker 2
And in that case, if someone gets bitten by an insect, what should they do? I mean, before they get to the hospital
[00:01:04.720] - Speaker 3
Yes, you need to go straight to the hospital, that's all. Calm down, stay calm. Yes, stay calm.
[00:01:09.570] - Speaker 1
You're panicking and getting desperate. Take it easy. The poison will spread and reach your heart. But don't worry, that's what he's after, to get there fast.
[00:01:24.610] - Speaker 2
But at least one example, Tulio, you know, one is going to leave the hospital and there
[00:01:28.760] - Speaker 4
Yes?
[00:01:28.990] - Speaker 3
He tied himself up. He tied himself up. Yes, and that's because the bite was too hard. That's because he almost lost his leg because of the tourniquet.
[00:01:46.740] - Speaker 4
And as I understand it, the snake bit him, and he didn't just leave, but went to tell Felipe: "Let's go find the snake, shall we?"
[00:01:54.260] - Speaker 1
And it took a long time to remove it. And the other thing was the tourniquet. He didn't let the poison circulate, so it accumulated in his leg.
[00:02:02.040] - Speaker 2
And that's what makes it rot.
[00:02:02.940] - Speaker 1
It rotted all his tissue. Well, his flesh.
[00:02:05.100] - Speaker 4
You hear people say that when you get bitten, God will watch over you and protect you, right? Because I just look at the Mecca.
[00:02:14.040] - Speaker 1
What a shame, cross it off.
[00:02:15.340] - Speaker 4
I am terrified of snakes. Terrified is the word; I am scared of them. But you hear people say that when a snake bites you, you should cut it in a cross shape so that the blood comes out.
[00:02:29.160] - Speaker 1
That's another thing that's not recommended either.
[00:02:33.210] - Speaker 3
Not recommended.
[00:02:34.430] - Speaker 1
Because one of them is dying. Because if the snake's venom doesn't kill him, he could die from gangrene.
[00:02:40.480] - Speaker 3
And it can cause an infection too.
[00:02:44.790] - Speaker 1
So, stay calm and find the hospital closest to where you are. And take the photo with you.
[00:02:52.580] - Speaker 4
The one they say was maybe a lot bigger.
[00:02:55.740] - Speaker 1
Look how big everything was.
[00:02:56.920] - Speaker 2
Yes, because you don't know that the snake died.
[00:02:58.480] - Speaker 4
If you have a photo from our photos.
[00:03:00.160] - Speaker 2
There are pages here, right? Yes.
[00:03:03.240] - Speaker 4
And he said they were a trumpet player's size, something like that.
[00:03:10.470] - Speaker 1
According to the experts on snakes that Charlie consulted, I was talking to them recently and I told them, "Send Charlie a photo of that snake." I had his phone number and they sent it to him so he could tell them exactly what kind of snake it was, because they said it was something else, that it had another name. And I told them, "He'll tell you what kind of snake it is. Send him the photo." They sent it, and he wrote back, "It's a size X, for sure. Don't worry about another name. It's size X. He's an expert on these things."
[00:03:47.270] - Speaker 2
Yes, they are people who know them, sometimes you know them, but Because they say that sometimes snakes cross your path, right?
[00:03:55.050] - Speaker 1
That's what they say, yes. But go and see for yourself, and that's the truth, who knows. The snake charmers Is it a lie? These guys say no. The experts on this stuff say it's not possible for a size X to cross paths with a... Supposedly, a mitao. Or with a cascabela or a mitao, that can't be. They're the ones who know. But there are people who have said: Yes, I killed a mitao and it had two fangs too. So, if it has fangs, it's because it has poison. Of course. So, it could be. But... Maybe it's not a mitao, but another snake and they say it's a mitao.
[00:04:38.640] - Speaker 2
And one says it's a myth, but it could be another snake.
[00:04:40.310] - Speaker 1
It could be someone else. But I told you that
[00:04:43.460] - Speaker 4
I went. The thing is, those animals are very ugly.
[00:04:48.930] - Speaker 3
Yes. Very beautiful, but very dangerous.
[00:04:52.370] - Speaker 2
Well, here on this farm, when I arrived, I arrived here 19 years ago. And here, at least in that part, there was a But thick. Yes, right? Indeed. That's where she was, because she had killed several animals. And when I got here, this was knocked down, everything. And a few days after it was knocked down and everything, I know that they put a fire there to burn some brush. Oh, Dad, and that was in the summer, but no one said anything, and the fire... I mean, everything caught fire. It started here and burned everything all the way over there, to that corner. That day I had left for Fuzi when they called me to say that a fire had started and that I shouldn't go. I told them, "Let it burn, because that shit was..." Was there a lot of teak? Tie it up there in the lake. Make a barrier there in the lake so it doesn't go over to the other side of the other farm, and tie it up.
[00:05:52.819] - Speaker 2
That was on a Saturday. On Tuesday, the boss came and we went to take a look, "Hey, man, how did it burn, how's it looking, you have to take a look and all that."
[00:06:04.380] - Speaker 2
And we got in here, in front: Ana, stay here. Over here, when the pimps come. The pimps are eating something, I tell her, some junk left over from Chucho, Dad, let's go check it out. That son of a bitch was this thick, but how did it make a tube like this? And some of them were like 50 feet long, that son of a bitch. But one thing, I mean, they had already eaten all the guts, and the bones looked like fish bones, they were like that and it was pure poison. But that was a big animal, that son of a bitch, I mean, and the ones that were here said that it had killed several animals. And it caught fire, and the fire was what But that was a lot... I hadn't seen... Well, maybe also, because it had been about three or four days, it had blown up. But that was a very, very, very big animal.
[00:07:05.130] - Speaker 1
Yes. Let's upload this to Because, what day didn't we come to Felipe's place, we didn't go back. Account of...
[00:07:15.980] - Speaker 2
The child from "Alguien de Armando en Santa Clara" has already been paid?
[00:07:22.070] - Speaker 1
No. Who am I? Where is this boy? Pedro Mejía.
[00:07:29.160] - Speaker 4
Where is Pedro Mejía? Mejía Gutiérrez.
[00:07:31.150] - Speaker 1
And now? He's Gutiérrez Mejía. Yes? Yes.
[00:07:35.600] - Speaker 2
Well, there are about three ranches there, Álvaro is there, he's
[00:07:39.200] - Speaker 4
You say Pedro, Pedro, the one over there, the one over there.
[00:07:42.380] - Speaker 1
Pedro Gutiérrez.
[00:07:43.520] - Speaker 4
Pedro Gutiérrez, yes.
[00:07:45.720] - Speaker 2
And over there to Santa Clara, over there to Santa Clara, yes, go on, over there, man, those people over there
[00:07:50.170] - Speaker 1
But no, the path must be
[00:07:51.700] - Speaker 2
No, the road is fine, the fence is backed up. No, they're backing up. Yes, the road is fine. Armando Llanos lives there. And Mandoleanos used to live there.
[00:07:59.280] - Speaker 4
And over there in Los Criales, they're also scraping by.
[00:08:01.730] - Speaker 2
Yes, the road is fine. Better than over there now. Yes.
[00:08:07.460] - Speaker 1
Anyway, the flies don't bother us.
[00:08:08.600] - Speaker 2
That's the worst part, son of a bitch, over there in Santa Clara it's really frustrating. Those bugs are still there.
[00:08:14.960] - Speaker 4
It's not repellent milk, it's just milk.
[00:08:18.920] - Speaker 2
But they're angry. No, it's just that one of them is standing still, or rather, they're making him
[00:08:22.380] - Speaker 1
I want to rain. Like a patch. You stand still and it pours down on you. Oh, you poor thing.
[00:08:27.820] - Speaker 2
It's over, time to buy again. Yes.
