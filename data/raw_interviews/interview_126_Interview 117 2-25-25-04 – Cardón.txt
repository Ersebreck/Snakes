So, do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:30.920] - Speaker 1
Yes, of course. Isn't she in the field? Yes, of course, she's not in the field. Because she could get bitten.

No, thank God, no. The rest of us have never been We've always been very careful about that.
[00:00:52.640] - Speaker 2
And do you know how to prevent or avoid a snake bite?
[00:00:57.880] - Speaker 1
In the field, that's what the doctor does most often, because that's what you look for first when you find a snake, to see what can be done.
[00:01:08.560] - Speaker 2
And before a snake bite, do you know how to avoid snakes and snake bites?
[00:01:17.730] - Speaker 1
Yes, you always have to be careful at night, not go out much, always carry a flashlight. And during the day, well, you say that in the countryside during the day, there are only images of chickens, so there are no colors. But yes, they've come down from the hills, because you couldn't see the rattles around here and a boy was killed by one. So now we're wary of them. Of course.
[00:01:45.290] - Speaker 2
And after a snake bite, would you go to the hospital in Carmen?
[00:01:52.130] - Speaker 1
Yes, because that's where you always end up, right? First there, and then they refer you to other hospitals. Yes, okay.
[00:01:59.420] - Speaker 2
And what would you trust at the hospital in Carmen to cure a snake bite?
[00:02:05.020] - Speaker 1
Well, I don't think the hospital is ready for that yet, is it? But yes, there, with the ambulance there, they can take you there quickly. Yes.
[00:02:15.460] - Speaker 2
Well, if you need to go to the hospital, is that difficult for you or easy?
[00:02:21.720] - Speaker 1
Well, sometimes we have to take a motorcycle taxi, or if we can, we call the hospital directly. Here in No, it's not because of snakes, but because of other things. If they haven't sent an ambulance, the fire department sends one. Yes, okay.
[00:02:37.230] - Speaker 2
So, where do you feel more likely to be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:02:47.560] - Speaker 1
Well, I don't know. Some people have been bitten on the trails. For example, Javier was bitten there in the ravine. But here in the house, no. Not always. Here, you can't see how to get in.
[00:03:03.980] - Speaker 2
And do you know how to identify poisonous snakes from non-poisonous ones?
[00:03:10.090] - Speaker 1
Well, no, that's true. I don't know, because they say that the most poisonous or deadly lebra is the size X. That's what I've always heard. As for the rest, all the other lebras are poisonous. I don't know how poisonous that red lebra is, what's it called? The What's it called? No, the coral one. Yes, that one too. That one is also poisonous. There are some of those around here too.
[00:03:42.600] - Speaker 2
And how do you identify different snakes? By their color, their skin, their?
[00:03:50.020] - Speaker 1
Yes, but he can't tell them apart by color.
[00:03:54.030] - Speaker 2
And do you know of any cases of snake bites?
[00:03:59.440] - Speaker 1
Yes, I know. There was a boy who was down in the ravine and his girlfriend died. And I'm going to keep it for that boy, even though he's sick and everything. He also got bitten by culeras there, near the house too. I don't know, they didn't die, but yes, everyone always got sick from it.
[00:04:20.100] - Speaker 2
Well, I don't have any more questions, but do you have anything else to say about snakes or your knowledge of snakes or anything else?
[00:04:30.900] - Speaker 1
No, I always told her that it's the most basic one, that is, size X. That's what I heard, the rest, if there are some small patches that they call sizes, the ones that didn't get done That here a dog bit her and she got a... Yes. When she got bitten, we heard the dog... When she screamed, we went and looked, the woman was there, we killed it, she came over and a little while later she was like this, her face all swollen. And then she took it up as a hobby. That's why we were afraid of the woman, but we liked her. Let's say it wasn't poison anymore, but around here we always had to fumigate the house. Because there's a tree around here, it's like at the exit. Yes, it's important to know, after a snake bite, do you need to go straight to the hospital?
[00:05:34.390] - Speaker 2
To the doctor, yes. Yes.
[00:05:34.730] - Speaker 1
And it is important to know which snake bit you, because there are different antivenoms for different snakes.
[00:05:44.700] - Speaker 2
You can take a photo of the snake or you can kill it and take it to the hospital.
[00:05:51.560] - Speaker 1
Yes, I did tell you that.
[00:05:53.180] - Speaker 2
But yes, that's all I have. Thank you very much for your time and your knowledge, it's very important and very kind of you. Thank you very much.
