What's your name? And how old are you? I'm . And what do you do? Do you work? No, I'm at home. Are you married or single? Not even a child. Do you have any children? No. And how long have you lived in Carmen?
[00:00:21.420] - Speaker 2
All my life, my whole life.
[00:00:25.830] - Speaker 1
So, do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:29.070] - Speaker 2
That could be, sure.
[00:00:32.510] - Speaker 1
Why?
[00:00:33.160] - Speaker 2
Because here in the countryside you're exposed at any moment when I don't feel like it. Yes.
[00:00:40.870] - Speaker 1
And have any of your animals been bitten by a snake, such as a pet or livestock? No. No? And do you know how to prevent or avoid a snake bite? No. No? What would you do if you were bitten by a snake?
[00:01:02.420] - Speaker 2
Go to the doctor because rushing to the doctor, she's slipping, she doesn't know what else to do.
[00:01:07.380] - Speaker 1
And which hospital would you go to?
[00:01:09.550] - Speaker 2
The closest one, not the hospital.
[00:01:11.400] - Speaker 1
El Carmen, okay. Would you trust the hospital in El Carmen? Also to treat a snake bite? As long as they have antivenom there, then yes. And would you trust other hospitals to treat a snake bite? Yes. And if you need to go to the hospital, is that difficult for you or easy?
[00:01:37.660] - Speaker 2
No, it's not that difficult. You don't need transportation; you can go anywhere.
[00:01:42.560] - Speaker 3
And where do you feel most likely to be bitten by a snake?
[00:01:47.900] - Speaker 1
In the countryside or at home?
[00:01:49.820] - Speaker 2
In the countryside, yes.
[00:01:54.240] - Speaker 1
Why?
[00:01:55.570] - Speaker 2
Because those little animals are in the countryside, everywhere, you can find them.
[00:02:01.100] - Speaker 1
Yes, of course. And can you tell if a snake is poisonous or venomous? No. And do you know of any cases of snake bites? Yes. And what happened in that case?
[00:02:19.560] - Speaker 2
The gentleman looked bad; he didn't look normal.
[00:02:23.420] - Speaker 1
After the bite Did the bite happen in the field or somewhere else?
[00:02:29.550] - Speaker 2
Yes, but did he go to the hospital too, or not? Yes, he went to the hospital. But then, it took a long time.
[00:02:42.690] - Speaker 1
Well, I don't have any more questions, but do you have anything else to say about snakes or your knowledge or anything else? No. Well, the most important information is that after a snake bite, it's important to go to the hospital. And it's important to know what kind of snake bit you, because there are different antivenoms for different snakes. And it's important to take a picture of the snake or kill it and take it to the hospital. And yes, I don't have any more questions, but thank you very much for your time, you're very kind.
