And how many years have you lived in El Carmen?
[00:00:33.870] - Speaker 1
Not El Carmen, I live in Bogotá. Until now, I was living in Porto Salina, in the municipality of Coyito Lima. I arrived here 15 days ago. But I'm from here.
[00:00:44.060] - Speaker 2
Yes, okay.
[00:00:45.240] - Speaker 1
But I was there looking at a That's where I have my crops. I have my crops there.
[00:00:51.440] - Speaker 2
Okay. So, do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:58.100] - Speaker 1
How?
[00:00:58.800] - Speaker 2
Do you think it is? And is it likely that you will be bitten by a snake here?
[00:01:04.050] - Speaker 1
Well, as far as I know, there are two bitten ones. That's Vidal. Vidal is from over there, from the roads, and Javier García. So, two bites are snake bites, X-shaped. Yes. Because that's the most common one here. Yes.
[00:01:25.430] - Speaker 2
And have any of your animals been bitten by a snake, such as a pet or livestock? No. No? No.
[00:01:35.510] - Speaker 1
Suddenly, if a cow died, it died there.
[00:01:42.700] - Speaker 2
And did the cow die?
[00:01:43.760] - Speaker 1
She died, let it be carved in stone. She stays like that, upright and swollen. And the pimps, the pimps, the pimps, the pimps, the pimps, the pimps, the pimps, the pimps, they don't eat her. They don't eat her, they surround her. Until the king arrives, the king arrives, the big one. And there, until: Now it's hard, there. And the pimps, during the day, in life, and I tell them: The last one, she's had it, there, and the pimps hate him with a passion and I tell them that in the end they'll eat her, but they're afraid of him.
[00:02:04.940] - Speaker 2
Yes.
[00:02:05.750] - Speaker 1
So you can see what the animals are like, right? You know.
[00:02:10.180] - Speaker 2
And do you know how to prevent or avoid a snake bite?
[00:02:16.150] - Speaker 1
Avoid a snake bite? Yes. Well, you have to take care of yourself. I, at least, am very careful in that regard. I am a farmer and work in the fields, and I was away from the farm for a month and a half in Bogotá, and nothing happened. And I came and opened the door, but there was a gap under the door. I arrived, but I always went in, I kind of did something to it. I said: I'm going to be away for a month and a half, maybe there'll be an animal here. I feel strange. And I lifted the bed, lifted a piece of foam, and that animal bit me on the leg. And once I unloaded the pig and went outside, it brought me a stick, because I don't like to kill it with a comb. I like to kill it with a stick, I don't like to kill my companion with a comb. I don't like to kill my companion, I don't like to kill a heifer.
[00:03:12.152] - Speaker 1
A heifer, you just subdue it before you hit it in the middle. Hit it here on the spine, and you'll leave it crippled.
[00:03:20.860] - Speaker 1
She doesn't go anywhere, not here, not there, not anywhere. She jumps around because she's crippled from the blow across the middle. That's it. I killed her. I killed that But I'm bad. I mean, I take a path with a flashlight and shine and shine, but I don't leave. If she knows where this bitch lives, I'm not leaving. Here in Carmen, the bitches bite you. You know how far it is. Yes. It's very close.
[00:03:49.860] - Speaker 2
Yes.
[00:03:50.830] - Speaker 1
Up there and high. It's producing, it's producing. Some people kill them, but these ones produce. And there are some, right? So what's the problem with producing so much size X here in this region? Because of the ravines. The ravine is what More size X. The ravines. And the guabla tree. Here, the guabla tree, you have to cut it very carefully, because they're already intertwined. That's right, you have to be careful, stop at night, and always use a light, don't get used to not using a light, don't walk around in the dark, because it's dangerous.
[00:04:31.340] - Speaker 2
Yes. And what would you do if a snake died?
[00:04:37.940] - Speaker 1
Well, here they don't have an antibiotic that Back on the farm where I live, in Puerto Salina, there's an animal called a burugo. There are lots of them there. There are lots of burugos on the farm where I live. There, they kill the burugo, take out its gallbladder, and mix it with aguardiente, a red liquor. And when a snake bites someone, they give them that gallbladder with the aguardiente. Not so that... You have to take them immediately, otherwise they won't give it to them. It's not so that... It's first aid to take them to the main area, where they say they have to be given serum. But there they use that group's guide, there are a lot of them, my husband, of those. But right now there was a brigade of that environmental thing, and they can't kill them anymore, they weren't going to kill them anymore, because they put up signs on all the farms, prohibiting hunting on those farms, they put up all the signs, so no one went around killing them.
[00:05:43.759] - Speaker 1
We don't kill them.
[00:05:46.500] - Speaker 2
Would you go to the hospital after a snake bite or not? Immediately.
[00:05:53.070] - Speaker 1
Immediately, you have to go to the doctor to see what solution they give you, because if that's the snake bite, it's the fastest thing I have to deal with, as a hypertensive person. I'm hypertensive, I go to Bogotá and I go there with high blood pressure, and when I get there, even if there are 500 or 600 people, they treat me, because I'm chronically hypertensive. And I go to Bogotá, and once I left Puerto Salina because I went to burn some land to plant crops and my blood pressure went up, but I couldn't get it down. I felt like I had a burning sensation in my face and head, and it wouldn't go away. And in Bogotá, there in Puentealanda, they treated me with medicine. And that's immediate, you go and they treat you right away, because that's a disease that if you don't treat it quickly, you can die, a heart attack, anything.
[00:06:45.940] - Speaker 2
And would you trust the hospital in Carmen to treat a snake bite?
[00:06:53.210] - Speaker 1
In El Carmen, they give you first aid, and that's where they sent him. A Mayra fan or a Girardón or an Espinal, because that's what I'm telling you, a snake bite is very delicate because the venom spreads immediately. It's extremely delicate.
[00:07:17.630] - Speaker 2
And if you need to go to the hospital, is that difficult for you or easy?
[00:07:22.410] - Speaker 1
Who says so?
[00:07:23.490] - Speaker 2
If you need to go to the hospital, is it difficult for you or is it easy?
[00:07:28.610] - Speaker 1
No, easy. Okay, fine. Let's see, yes, sure.
[00:07:33.760] - Speaker 2
And where do you feel most likely to be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:07:42.600] - Speaker 1
Let it bite you. How does a snake bite you? Logically, in the countryside, on the path where you walk. Yes. They're there. They don't go into houses anymore because we humans live sweeping, throwing away the mosquitoes, using something, so they don't go in. But as soon as the house is empty, they go in. Look, there's one over there Down there, in the traffic we have, down there, at my mother's. And you, I think you knew the Rodríguez family. Of course, the Rodríguez family. I think the Rodríguez family is related to you. No. Wasn't it a García? No. Mrs. Rosa? No. Wasn't Mrs. Rosa, with Mrs. Mercedes, related to you? No. Well, that house, I'll be careful. Two old ladies lived in that house, both of them are dead now, Mrs. Sofía and her daughter. They lived there. And they came to the farm to do a No, it's a check to make sure there are no animals.
[00:08:49.018] - Speaker 1
Two old women lived there with two old men. Two snakes inside. When the lady saw one come out, inside a storeroom, in a storeroom that was full... And then the snakes, that happens, the snakes, leave something still, still, and don't move it, they're there.
[00:09:10.940] - Speaker 2
There they are. And do you know how to tell poisonous snakes from non-poisonous ones?
[00:09:20.800] - Speaker 1
Yes. Poisonous, as far as I know, poisonous, fierce, fierce, rattlesnake, size X, coral. As far as I know, if that's the case, poisonous, fierce. From here to this region, because they're no longer eastern, there are others that are already more different. Four noses, where they call one a colera out there.
[00:09:40.640] - Speaker 2
And how do you identify different snakes?
[00:09:43.880] - Speaker 1
How?
[00:09:44.820] - Speaker 2
How do you identify different snakes?
[00:09:47.490] - Speaker 1
The snakes. Well, size X has the X's. The X's are like little coffees, like a small coffee. The coral one is red and black. The rattlesnake is similar, somewhat like size X, but a little different, it changes a little, but it's almost the same.
[00:10:14.480] - Speaker 2
Do you know of any other cases of snake bites?
[00:10:21.090] - Speaker 1
I was once in Kundai, Tolima. There, a man was bitten by a snake and didn't survive. They took him to Mergar. He was practically dead when they brought him down. They brought him down dead from Kundai and took him to the cemetery in Mergar to But I'm going to see that. It's incredible how a person who is bitten in the community becomes like that. Then they swell up. They swell up because it's like the person swells up. Just like a net. A cow. And it's supposed to burst. That's what the poison of a brave man was like, right? Yes.
[00:11:06.590] - Speaker 2
And, well, I don't have any more questions, but do you have anything else to say about snakes or your knowledge of snakes or anything else?
[00:11:18.770] - Speaker 1
Not at the moment, ma'am. That's what I gave you.
[00:11:22.430] - Speaker 2
And the most important information is after a snake bite, is it important and the right to go to the hospital.
[00:11:31.840] - Speaker 1
There is no other option but to go to the hospital because there is nothing else you can do. You can't do anything, why? Because it's a very delicate matter. I have to go to the hospital so they can give me the information they need to explain to me.
[00:11:46.620] - Speaker 2
Yes. And it's important to know which snake killed you, because there are different antivenoms for different snakes. You can take a photo of the snake or you can kill it and take it to the hospital.
[00:12:00.830] - Speaker 1
So when she returned to live in the ravine, they took her away.
[00:12:04.090] - Speaker 2
Yes. But yes, okay. Thank you very much for your time. Very kind of you.
