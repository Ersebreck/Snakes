And how many years have you lived in El Carmen?
[00:00:30.240] - Speaker 2
Approximately four years ago.
[00:00:32.450] - Speaker 1
Okay. So, do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:38.340] - Speaker 2
Yes, of course, snakes have always been found here. Mostly there are several species, sizes, and coral snakes. You can also find those snakes with thin tails that wriggle around.
[00:00:57.190] - Speaker 1
Yes.
[00:00:58.990] - Speaker 2
The most common ones you will find.
[00:01:01.870] - Speaker 1
And have any of your animals been bitten by a snake, such as a pet or livestock?
[00:01:10.210] - Speaker 2
No, not that I know of right now. Not since I've been here.
[00:01:16.030] - Speaker 1
And do you know how to prevent or avoid a snake bite?
[00:01:21.900] - Speaker 2
Well, prevention means being careful and watching where you step, especially at night. Because at night, that's when you find snakes. They tend to come out more at night; you hardly ever find them during the day.
[00:01:40.520] - Speaker 1
And what would you do if a snake bit you?
[00:01:45.240] - Speaker 2
The first thing I would do, if I were near a hospital, would be to rush to the hospital and hopefully bandage myself, which they say is the best thing to do.
[00:01:59.100] - Speaker 1
And which one? And would you go to the hospital?
[00:02:01.630] - Speaker 2
No, well, first of all, I have to go here to Carmen, which is the closest one, and then they refer you to another one, and it depends. Yes.
[00:02:11.570] - Speaker 1
And if you need to go to the hospital, is that difficult for you or easy?
[00:02:16.610] - Speaker 2
Well, always, because here you don't have your own transportation, so you have to call, wait for transportation to arrive, and then take them once you're busy. So it's always complicated.
[00:02:33.580] - Speaker 1
Yes, of course. And where do you feel you are most likely to be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:02:45.110] - Speaker 2
No, here it's mostly when you go near places with lots of trees, tall grass, and also along the banks of streams and rivers. In the summer, they take advantage of the coolness, so they stay there to keep cool. They hardly ever come here to the house, depending on how clean it is.
[00:03:09.860] - Speaker 1
Do you know how to identify poisonous or venomous snakes?
[00:03:16.760] - Speaker 2
Yes, well, you kind of know which ones aren't so poisonous.
[00:03:23.950] - Speaker 1
And how do you identify different snakes?
[00:03:26.500] - Speaker 2
Well, here we know them by name, which is the one they call la bejuca, which is green. There's one that's Yes, because the rest, the size, the rávode, and so on.
[00:03:43.200] - Speaker 1
And do you identify snakes by their color or their skin?
[00:03:46.170] - Speaker 2
Yes, mainly because of the color; you already know them.
[00:03:51.540] - Speaker 1
And do you know of any cases of snake bites?
[00:03:55.680] - Speaker 2
Yes, recently a man from this town was bitten by one, in the river, actually, where I mentioned it. He was out looking for cattle, and something like that, it bit him.
[00:04:06.960] - Speaker 1
Javier?
[00:04:07.570] - Speaker 2
Yes, his name is Javier.
[00:04:11.820] - Speaker 1
I have no further questions, but do you have anything else to say about snakes or your knowledge or anything else to say about snakes?
[00:04:21.400] - Speaker 2
No, as I said, I hardly ever see them around here. You see them, but I've never had any problems with them. As long as you don't step on them, they go away. They're not that dangerous. Other than that, I don't know of any other cases.
[00:04:45.250] - Speaker 1
And the most important information is that after a snake bite, you need to go straight to the hospital. And it's important to know what kind of snake bit you, because there are different snakes and different antivenoms for different snakes. You can take a picture of the snake or you can kill it and take it to the hospital.
[00:05:10.010] - Speaker 2
Yes, it can kill.
[00:05:11.620] - Speaker 1
Yes. Because it's important to know which snake killed you. So if you need to kill it, take it to the hospital, that's fine.
[00:05:22.060] - Speaker 2
If it is permissible to kill her, as he has now proven by killing any animal, right?
[00:05:27.790] - Speaker 1
It is not advisable to kill all snakes because not all of them are poisonous, but if it died, that's fine. But put it in. Yes, I understand, but yes. Thank you, that's all I have. Thank you very much for your time. You're very kind.
