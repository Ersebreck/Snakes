I saw them all.
[00:00:27.500] - Speaker 1
So, do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:32.180] - Speaker 2
That's for sure, a fulebra, all the time.
[00:00:34.310] - Speaker 1
Have any of your animals ever been bitten by a snake, such as a pet? No, not at the moment. Do you know how to prevent or avoid a snake bite?
[00:00:51.190] - Speaker 2
Well, what I've heard and seen is that they bite it and squeeze it hard and take it to the doctor. Yes.
[00:00:59.900] - Speaker 1
I don't know anything else like that. But before a snake bite, do you know how to avoid snakes or snake bites? Before a bite.
[00:01:11.430] - Speaker 2
Before a bite? Yes. She's one of the colleagues who avoids them. Don't bother them because they know they're animals and you have to leave them alone.
[00:01:20.870] - Speaker 1
And what would you do if a snake bit you?
[00:01:27.000] - Speaker 2
Well, it would be very difficult for a snake to move someone here, because it's very light. I'm practically alone with my dad, I watched it while my husband was out. Well, the best thing to do would be to call someone to come and get you out of here so you can go to the doctor.
[00:01:49.680] - Speaker 1
And would you go to the hospital in Carmen or another hospital?
[00:01:55.200] - Speaker 2
No, not Carmen. Why? Because I've seen many people die there with emergencies. So, the rest must be pulled out to turn two.
[00:02:09.170] - Speaker 1
And where do you feel you are most likely to be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:02:22.030] - Speaker 2
The truth is, I catch them here, inside the house. So sometimes you wake up in the dark and they can bite you inside the house just like outside. Yes.
[00:02:37.520] - Speaker 1
And do you know how to identify poisonous snakes from non-poisonous ones?
[00:02:43.820] - Speaker 2
Well, they say that hunting isn't poisonous now, but right now they're like crossbreds, because sometimes animals have arrived here that aren't poisonous and are relatives or were once poisonous, now crossbred. To be honest, I like your pira.
[00:03:06.530] - Speaker 1
Better.
[00:03:07.190] - Speaker 2
Give it to the pedestrians.
[00:03:09.030] - Speaker 1
And when you identify snakes, do you identify them by color or by the bell or by other methods?
[00:03:18.790] - Speaker 2
There's one that's kind of pinkish, which they say is What's it called? La candela. There are others that are red with a black stripe, which they say is coral. The size, which is kind of rotten, the hunter. So, yes, you have more or less...
[00:03:41.510] - Speaker 1
And do you know of a case of a What kind of snake bite was it?
[00:03:47.380] - Speaker 2
I heard about a woman who was bitten by a snake in Novillo. She went to cut an anus. She got close, came out to look at it, and it bit her. That woman died. Yes, okay.
[00:04:03.440] - Speaker 1
That I had to say, yes.
[00:04:05.520] - Speaker 2
And just recently, the son of Pablo Emilio, the crazy Pablo Lunde, was also bitten by a plant around here, and he was in serious condition too.
[00:04:15.900] - Speaker 1
And, well, I don't have any more questions, but you have more to say about snakes or your connection, right? Uh-huh. And the most important information is what to do after a snake bite and how to get to the hospital. And it's important to know what kind of snake bit you, because there are different antivenoms for different snakes. So, you can take a picture of the snake or you can kill it and take it to the hospital. But that's the important information about snake bites. But I don't have anything else. Thank you very much for your time. You're welcome. No.
