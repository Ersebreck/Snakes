Maybe 35.
[00:00:35.390] - Speaker 2
So, do you think it's likely that you'll be bitten by a snake here in El Carmen, in this part of town?
[00:00:43.420] - Speaker 1
Yes, of course, it's possible. Yes, yes.
[00:00:45.140] - Speaker 2
Why?
[00:00:46.470] - Speaker 1
Because it's an area where there are a lot of snakes. And sometimes I put a lot on them, because I have a farm out there and you're out there. And when you work in the fields, you're always exposed to all kinds of bites.
[00:01:03.050] - Speaker 2
Yes. And have any of your animals been bitten by a snake? Like a pet or livestock?
[00:01:15.430] - Speaker 1
No, I haven't seen one. I was bitten by one once.
[00:01:19.900] - Speaker 2
Really? Sure. A poisonous one? Yes. Which snake?
[00:01:24.520] - Speaker 1
X Street.
[00:01:26.000] - Speaker 2
What happened? Did the bite happen in the field? Yes.
[00:01:39.530] - Speaker 1
What happened? Up here in an oga. She was in an oga. She was working there, and we found her with her son. And since the boys had already come, Charlie called him, the boys were already And I had been with them over there.
[00:01:55.350] - Speaker 2
Is it us, Charlie, or is it different? Uh-huh.
[00:01:59.880] - Speaker 1
When they came here, I used to go out with them to look for snakes. I worked with them.
[00:02:08.210] - Speaker 2
To search for snakes.
[00:02:11.310] - Speaker 1
Yes. They taught me which ones were dangerous and which ones weren't poisonous. I learned that and got to know some of them. And while I was working on the construction site with my son, he found a big one and said to me, "Dad, what kind of snake is this?" I glanced at it quickly and thought it was one of the harmless ones, the ones that aren't poisonous. And I picked it up with my hand and put it here on my arm. On your arm? Yes, because I've picked up the ones that aren't poisonous, they taught me how to pick them up. But I got confused. I picked it up and put it here. And as soon as I picked it up, it wrapped itself around my hand and one of the two molvisión snakes bit me here. I went and it bit me right into the vein, this vein. But it only used one tooth. And I felt the bite like a wasp sting. Yes, just like a wasp sting.
[00:03:13.724] - Speaker 1
Then, when I saw that she bit me, that's when I looked closely and realized that it was poisonous, because the ones that aren't poisonous don't bite. No matter how much you bother them, touch them, they put their fingers in their mouths, you provoke them, and they don't bite.
[00:03:35.620] - Speaker 1
So, that's how it was. And again, it was getting ready to bite me again. So, I had a tile in my hand and it fell there. When it fell there, it picked itself up and I didn't know what to do. We looked at it closely, we watched it, it was a size X. And no, nothing, I wasn't scared or anything. I didn't Well, I waited a little while to see what would happen, and it hurt like a wasp sting.
[00:04:08.240] - Speaker 2
And did you kill the snake? No. Did you kill the snake?
[00:04:12.480] - Speaker 1
No, we didn't kill that one. You were so little. And then we picked it up and took it away, threw it far away. We didn't want to kill it. There was a woman there who came to the house and told me to kill it, that it was better to kill it. Well, I told her I had killed it, but I hadn't. Lately, the boys have taught me that there are colors that are better not to kill. Well, maybe the poisonous ones, yes, that one was poisonous, of course, it was huge, we didn't know it.
[00:04:40.660] - Speaker 2
And were you with Charlie?
[00:04:42.520] - Speaker 1
No, that was about a year ago. They've already left here. It didn't hurt that much, so I took off my shirt and saw a tiny black spot, just one little dot. And it didn't itch much. Maybe because of the shirt, it didn't bother me. It wasn't very big, so I thought it was just a tiny thing. Then, suddenly, the shirt had a wrinkle or something and that prevented it from It had bitten me completely. I had lunch and lay down. I fell asleep.
[00:05:22.700] - Speaker 2
Didn't you go to the hospital right away?
[00:05:24.440] - Speaker 1
No. No, because I didn't feel any pain. Maybe I was a little scared or something. Some time passed, and I fell asleep. After a while, about an hour later, I woke up and everything was black, all purple. Purple, totally purple. The area was completely round, like that. And the spot where it had pricked me was red. But no, nothing, I woke up and didn't feel any pain. At no point did I feel nervous or anything. I just carried on as normal. It took about 15 days for the mark to disappear. Fifteen days. It gradually faded away. And that was it. The little dot stayed there in the vein for about five months, until it disappeared. And I haven't had any other experiences like that, I haven't seen anyone else get a bruise like that, no. Not even animals.
[00:06:31.990] - Speaker 2
But you went to the hospital, right? No. Never?
[00:06:35.250] - Speaker 1
No, never.
[00:06:36.690] - Speaker 2
Did the snake not inject venom, or what happened? Did it not inject venom?
[00:06:52.430] - Speaker 1
I think the problem is that I sometimes use cannabis, and I had just used cannabis. I say that was it, the antidote, because what else could it have been if I didn't go to the doctor or anything? I think that was it, because it's an antidote for many things. I'm also going to say it's for scorpion stings, for many illnesses. And I think that's what it was, I think that's what it was because what else could it have been? So, since I didn't feel any reaction and what I had in my body, I didn't feel any urge to do anything. Despair, yes, suddenly, or I felt something serious or something like that, even on the motorcycle already But no, nothing happened. And I think that's what it was, the minute because... Yes, I think that's what it was. Because it had been 10 minutes since I had consumed it. And I imagine that was it. Because what else could it be? And I've already proven that sometimes it works for many things.
[00:08:07.639] - Speaker 1
But I didn't know that, I didn't know that. But it was even like an experience, which I think was useful because I believe that was it, because yes, it injected some poison into me, but with just one tooth, just one little prick.
[00:08:26.880] - Speaker 1
And when it was all set up like that: But it's green, ugly, ugly, ugly. And it touched me and I felt like I was asleep.
[00:08:38.930] - Speaker 2
And you didn't feel much pain, ever?
[00:08:43.330] - Speaker 1
No, just like a wasp sting. Yes. The little thing, very slow, very little.
[00:08:50.770] - Speaker 2
And now do you know how to prevent snake bites, or do you have other methods for preventing snake bites?
[00:09:09.780] - Speaker 1
So, as a preventive measure, what do we have here? No, not much here. The traditional remedies that farmers have always used here, such as borugo, from a small animal, is what most people have, because there is no other known antidote, apart from medicine. And the other thing is caution. Caution, being on the lookout for it everywhere, because you do find it around here all the time. That's the only way to avoid it. And there's no other antidote, no. Someone said that last time they said petroleum, that they took petroleum, but now that doesn't exist anymore.
[00:10:00.510] - Speaker 2
And now, if you got another snake bite, would you go to the hospital or not?
[00:10:12.020] - Speaker 1
Depending on how you feel.
[00:10:14.680] - Speaker 2
Yes. And if you feel sick or unwell, would you go to the hospital?
[00:10:18.560] - Speaker 1
Sure, I would go to the hospital. Sure, if I understand correctly, yes, totally, I wouldn't hesitate.
[00:10:22.940] - Speaker 2
Yes, okay, I understand. And how would you trust the hospital, in Carmen, to treat a surgical wound?
[00:10:33.940] - Speaker 1
No, because I've heard many cases, I've heard many cases where they do absolutely nothing. They even leave them there to die, because it's a very efficient hospital for that type of emergency.
[00:10:52.730] - Speaker 2
Would you trust other hospitals to treat you?
[00:10:55.100] - Speaker 1
Yes, of course, in others it does. Which ones? Perhaps closer to the city, Girardó, maybe Espinal, Bogotá, where there is more service and it is more efficient.
[00:11:08.800] - Speaker 2
And where do you feel most likely to be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:11:18.270] - Speaker 1
In the countryside.
[00:11:19.410] - Speaker 2
Why?
[00:11:21.880] - Speaker 1
Well, because that's where there are the most Same at home, yes, and here in the countryside too. They've even come into the house.
[00:11:29.570] - Speaker 2
Yes.
[00:11:30.270] - Speaker 1
So, in this region, when you're out in the countryside, there's always the possibility that one could appear at any moment, whether it's night or day, because they're very active at night. That snake is active at night. And around here there are other kinds of snakes, other kinds of poisonous snakes, but fortunately I almost always see them. It's always like Because I've been very exposed, having them around. But you always have to trust that God is watching over you, and you have to see them first.
[00:12:08.780] - Speaker 2
And do you know how to identify poisonous snakes or snakes that are venomous?
[00:12:14.230] - Speaker 1
Yes.
[00:12:15.380] - Speaker 2
How do you identify snakes? How? How do you identify snakes?
[00:12:20.840] - Speaker 1
The Charlie boys taught me how to identify the ones that aren't poisonous, and now I pretty much know them. But I got that one wrong because my eyesight isn't very good and I saw it so quickly, as they look very similar. Yes. Yes, that size is very similar to the mantis snake. It's very similar.
[00:12:48.850] - Speaker 2
And do you identify snakes by their color, their skin, their head, or?
[00:12:55.230] - Speaker 1
Yes. By the head, neck, tail, and color.
[00:13:06.760] - Speaker 2
Do you know of any other cases of snake-like moles?
[00:13:12.420] - Speaker 1
I have been told, yes, people have mentioned it to me, yes. But I did not see it happen at the time, no. However, I have seen, at least, the operations they underwent.
[00:13:27.800] - Speaker 2
And does anyone know anyone who has remorsefully renounced their snake?
[00:13:32.840] - Speaker 1
Yes, of course, I know someone who was bitten by a snake about two months ago, maybe a year ago. The guy from up there, where you guys hang out. Yes, up there, the guy was bitten by a big one, it was really big. It bit him here. And they took him to the hospital. And now they operated on him, they opened him up from here, everything, everything, everything, everything, everything. And now he's healed, but he still has the problem that after it bit him, he lost feeling. And a lot of times he's walking and he falls down. We call him Cachirro, but I don't know what his name was. Yes, he has that problem.
[00:14:23.760] - Speaker 2
And if you need to go to the hospital, is that difficult for you or easy?
[00:14:33.680] - Speaker 1
Well, around here, right now, it's not so complicated, of course, because now he helps out with the motorcycle, so you can get anywhere quickly, depending on how close you are. Because the farm I have is over there, in the mountains. So, out there, it would take longer if something happened, because there's no access by motorcycle or car out there. It's about half an hour. And then, of course, the time it would take to get him from here to the hospital.
[00:15:11.630] - Speaker 2
And, for example, just if your son had a snake bite, I'm sorry. Would you go to the hospital with him? Would I go to the hospital? Yes. How do you say that? Would you wait and see if he's in pain before going to the hospital? Do you understand me? Yes.
[00:16:02.990] - Speaker 1
No, I would take it immediately. I would take it immediately, I wouldn't think twice about it. Yes, one by one.
[00:16:12.880] - Speaker 2
And I don't have any more questions, but do you have anything else to say about snakes or your experiences or your knowledge of snakes or anything else?
[00:16:27.710] - Speaker 1
Something the boys taught me, what they taught me was
[00:16:31.040] - Speaker 2
Diego and Charlie.
[00:16:34.070] - Speaker 1
How do you say it? Diego and Charlie. Diego, Diego, and Charlie, yes. They taught me. At least what I learned from them was to distinguish between offensive and brave ones, the ones that are not. Yes. Yes, that's what I learned from them, because I didn't have the opportunity to learn more about the processes they use or other things like feeding them. I was busy working, and they told me to come, but I couldn't because I was working. But yes, that point, distinguishing the ones that aren't poisonous, some of them.
[00:17:12.370] - Speaker 2
And snakes usually don't want to bite, but if you step on a snake
[00:17:24.040] - Speaker 1
Exactly, if you touch it, yes. Even that snake, that carving, they taught me that it doesn't attack you just because you walk by its foot, no. You have to touch it, make contact with it for it to And it's happened to me because I've had these classrooms close by, close to my face, this close, or close to my body when you see it there.
[00:17:51.020] - Speaker 2
And yes, the important information is But you know, after a snake bite, it's important to go straight to the hospital. Yes. And it's important to know what kind of snake bit you. Exactly. And you can take a picture, a photo of the snake, or you can kill it and take it to the hospital.
[00:18:19.510] - Speaker 1
Yes.
[00:18:20.100] - Speaker 2
But that's what's most important.
[00:18:24.540] - Speaker 1
Exactly. Yes, to know what kind of snake it is. Yes, yes. For the antidote.
[00:18:29.770] - Speaker 2
Yes, exactly. There are different antidotes for different snakes. That's important. Yes, but thank you very much. I don't have any more questions. You interviewed him.
[00:18:42.700] - Speaker 1
Well, thank you very much.
[00:18:43.520] - Speaker 2
Yes. Thank you very much.
