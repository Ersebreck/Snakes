So, when she opened her mouth, it wasn't very big, it was tiny, barely touching my finger, over there like that, more or less. She was tied up very tightly. And since she was wearing a shirt, that always helped.

And I said: I can catch it. To show him, because I wanted to show him which ones are dangerous and which ones aren't. But I didn't look very quickly. I just saw it like that, picked it up and put it there.
