Lorena.
[00:00:03.420] - Speaker 2
And how old are you?
[00:00:05.540] - Speaker 1
28. What do you do for a living? I'm a farmer.
[00:00:13.890] - Speaker 2
Are you married or single?
[00:00:17.630] - Speaker 1
Single.
[00:00:18.100] - Speaker 2
And do you have children? Yes. And how many years have you lived in El Carmen?
[00:00:23.670] - Speaker 1
Three, maybe four years ago.
[00:00:27.210] - Speaker 2
So, do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here? Yes. Why?
[00:00:32.490] - Speaker 1
Because I've already had several.
[00:00:34.510] - Speaker 2
Yes, of course. Have any of your animals been bitten by a snake, such as a pet or livestock? No. And do you know how they prevented snake bites? No. Okay. What would you do if you were bitten by a snake?
[00:00:51.730] - Speaker 1
Someone will call you, honestly, whoever it is, but call someone.
[00:00:55.010] - Speaker 2
Yes, okay. So what would you do?
[00:00:58.710] - Speaker 1
Well, first, if there's someone around, call them. If not, look, pull it out. They say the first thing to do is to draw the blood, suck the blood out, in case you've been bitten by a snake.
[00:01:10.760] - Speaker 2
I understand. Yes, yes, yes. And would you go? And you wouldn't go to the hospital?
[00:01:17.370] - Speaker 1
I don't know. Yes, obviously I would have to go to the But, Carmen, it's difficult.
[00:01:25.680] - Speaker 2
Wouldn't you trust the hospital in this case? No.
[00:01:28.240] - Speaker 1
Why? Not because it happened to me, but because I've heard a lot about how they don't treat them well. So, I don't know if it's safer to go there or stay at home. Yes, of course.
[00:01:40.140] - Speaker 2
Would you trust other hospitals to treat a snake bite?
[00:01:44.320] - Speaker 1
Yes, I think they need to have the right tools to do it. I understand. Yes.
[00:01:54.280] - Speaker 2
If you need to go to the hospital, is it difficult for you or is it easy?
[00:02:00.120] - Speaker 1
In the event that she has the bite block, I am uncertain why. The motorcycle is available, but my daughter does not know how to ride it, so I am uncertain of the likelihood of her arriving safely at the car.
[00:02:10.860] - Speaker 2
And where do you feel it's most likely to happen? And why would a snake kill you? In the countryside or at home?
[00:02:19.440] - Speaker 1
In the countryside.
[00:02:20.450] - Speaker 2
Why?
[00:02:21.730] - Speaker 1
No, I've only found them here in the house, to be honest. I haven't seen them outside, but I think it's more likely they're here inside. Yes, obviously.
[00:02:32.860] - Speaker 2
Can you tell if a snake is poisonous or not?
[00:02:36.320] - Speaker 1
Well, they're teaching me, but I don't know them yet.
[00:02:40.280] - Speaker 2
Yes, it's difficult. And you don't know of a case of snake bruising?
[00:02:47.390] - Speaker 1
No, not that I've seen, no.
[00:02:49.170] - Speaker 2
I have no further questions, but do you have anything else to say about snakes or your knowledge?
[00:02:58.230] - Speaker 1
No, I don't really have much. How can I put it? There's a lot to it, because I've never been bitten and I've never seen anyone else get bitten, so I can't really say.
[00:03:13.170] - Speaker 2
Yes, I understand. Yes, no problem. And the most important information when you have a snake bite is that you need to go straight to the hospital after a snake bite. And it's important to know what kind of snake bit you, because there are different antivenoms for different snakes. You can take a picture of the snake or you can kill it and take it to the hospital.
[00:03:46.700] - Speaker 1
Okay, ready.
[00:03:47.940] - Speaker 2
Yes, it would be the same. Yes, that's what I think.
[00:03:50.970] - Speaker 1
I don't really know them, so I wouldn't know which one is which The poisonous one and the one that isn't.
[00:03:56.670] - Speaker 2
Yes, exactly. Okay. But thank you. You're welcome. Okay. Thank you very much, you're very kind.
