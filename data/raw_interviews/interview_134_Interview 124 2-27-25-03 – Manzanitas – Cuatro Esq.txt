I was married to my husband for four years.
[00:00:25.420] - Speaker 2
And how many years have you lived in Carmen?
[00:00:29.770] - Speaker 1
I was married for about 35 years.
[00:00:34.230] - Speaker 2
So, do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:39.470] - Speaker 1
I've never been bitten by one.
[00:00:40.980] - Speaker 2
And any animals? Have you ever been bitten by a snake, a pet, or livestock? No, I haven't. Do you know how to prevent or avoid a snake bite?
[00:00:55.720] - Speaker 1
I've been told that you have to wear a garter belt to hold the poison in place. That's what I've heard.
[00:01:06.750] - Speaker 2
And before a love of helping snakes.
[00:01:10.440] - Speaker 1
But that's it. And they've also told me, I mean, it's never happened, but you never know, so be very prepared, because they'll beat you up and smash your head a little, and they'll bandage your wound, but with whatever they put on it That's what I know. Okay. Yes, well, that's what I understand, honestly. I don't know any more, because we live on a farm like this, so you never know. They have to take you to a health center. Because she herself is determined to get the poison, that's what I hear.
[00:01:46.470] - Speaker 2
And what would you do if a snake bit you?
[00:01:51.550] - Speaker 1
I would do as you say, while I move down a spot.
[00:01:55.200] - Speaker 2
Would you go to the hospital?
[00:01:56.700] - Speaker 1
Yes, ma'am.
[00:01:57.740] - Speaker 2
Which hospital?
[00:01:59.150] - Speaker 1
To the hospital, yes.
[00:02:00.260] - Speaker 2
In Carmen or somewhere else?
[00:02:02.680] - Speaker 1
Well, I always have some. Right now I have nine weights, but I have enough to rotate two. But always, because of where I live, right now, since they made me use them, I've always had to go to Ibagué to get a big thyroid removed. I've always had to travel, but it's always private. I've had to pay for all my own expenses. But yes, if there's an emergency, you do it here in the village, not the nearest place, the health center for that. Yes.
[00:02:31.560] - Speaker 2
And where do you feel most likely to be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:02:40.350] - Speaker 1
They can bite you in the house too, yes ma'am, because you never know if they'll come out at night or not. They always attack from behind.
[00:02:50.260] - Speaker 2
And do you know how to identify poisonous and non-poisonous snakes?
[00:03:00.540] - Speaker 1
Yes, ma'am. I know there are people who say: It's the size. That if it's fierce, the one with the yellow tail is fierce.
[00:03:07.590] - Speaker 2
Yes, okay. Yes.
[00:03:09.610] - Speaker 1
Well, I have a rough idea, because my husband has taught me and I learn a lot from him, because it's hard work and everything, so I teach him. Because you go with someone and you don't know anything, you've never worked before. So, with him, I learned a lot of things, like the choir, the nojé, well, anyway, yes, ma'am.
[00:03:31.230] - Speaker 2
And do you know of any cases of snake bites?
[00:03:37.530] - Speaker 1
Well, my sister-in-law, my husband's sister, María, was bitten by a snake when she went to the bathroom, but she didn't think it was a big deal. She said no, don't take me to the hospital, and she died 24 hours later. They found out later, I don't know.
[00:03:57.340] - Speaker 2
But it was just a little thing, going into the bathroom.
[00:04:00.130] - Speaker 1
But not me, thank God, I never encounter snakes like that around here. I've always been cautious and kept my flashlight or cell phone on, although I didn't always use it.
[00:04:12.090] - Speaker 2
Do you have any other prevention methods?
[00:04:14.920] - Speaker 1
No, I don't know anything else, that's all I know.
[00:04:17.680] - Speaker 2
And I also know a method, because I know that older people still say that bubble gel is very good with aguardiente, which for me means that it's very good, so he doesn't need to go to a
[00:04:30.790] - Speaker 1
Yes, because my father took that and there was no need to take him to the hospital. When you have it, you have it, you play with your dad, and in the meantime, as I say, you do what you can until help arrives.
[00:04:47.420] - Speaker 2
Yes, of course.
[00:04:48.490] - Speaker 1
Because not all snakes are poisonous, but you often think they are. No, I know more or less. Rubén taught me which ones are poisonous to me. No. But they still bite, don't they?
[00:05:00.450] - Speaker 2
Sure, yes. But you don't understand. Yes, exactly. And if you need to go to the hospital, is that difficult for you or is it easy?
[00:05:10.420] - Speaker 1
No, you.
[00:05:11.400] - Speaker 2
Do you have a motorcycle? No. I don't have my daughter's scooter.
[00:05:15.120] - Speaker 1
But you always need to have your matizón here for emergencies. Yes. Or your son.
[00:05:21.610] - Speaker 2
Okay.
[00:05:22.640] - Speaker 1
Yes, ma'am.
[00:05:24.270] - Speaker 2
And, well, I don't have any more questions, but do you have anything else to say about your teeth or your knowledge, anything else to add?
[00:05:34.080] - Speaker 1
No.
[00:05:34.750] - Speaker 2
And, well, the most important information is that after a snake bite, you need to go straight to the hospital.
[00:05:44.570] - Speaker 1
Yes, ma'am.
[00:05:45.260] - Speaker 2
And it's important to know which snake bit you, because there are different kinds
[00:05:50.390] - Speaker 1
Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. Yes, that's right.
[00:05:53.550] - Speaker 2
And yes, you can take a picture of the snake, you can kill it, take it to the hospital, and so on. But that's all the important information. Thank you very much for your time. I don't have any more questions. You're very kind. Thank you very much.
