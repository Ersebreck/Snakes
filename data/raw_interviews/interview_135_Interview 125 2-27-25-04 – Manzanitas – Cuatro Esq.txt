Carlos Blanca.

And how old are you?
[00:00:05.510] - Speaker 1
39.
[00:00:06.880] - Speaker 2
And what do you do for a living?
[00:00:08.400] - Speaker 1
I am a caregiver here in Cartier.
[00:00:10.720] - Speaker 2
Are you married or single?
[00:00:13.560] - Speaker 1
I am in a relationship with my daughter.
[00:00:16.170] - Speaker 2
And do you have children? Yes. And how many years have you lived in El Carmen?
[00:00:21.930] - Speaker 1
I'm going to be six soon.
[00:00:25.780] - Speaker 2
Okay. So, do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:30.490] - Speaker 1
Well, anything is possible in life.
[00:00:34.310] - Speaker 2
And have any of your animals been bitten by a snake, such as a pet or a dog?
[00:00:42.170] - Speaker 1
Well, once a little dog died here and no one knew why. The dog I thought it was bitten by a snake or some other animal, and it ran off into the woods. We found it in Monte Muerto about three days later. But we never found out what bit it. We didn't know if it was a snake or not.
[00:01:07.210] - Speaker 2
And do you know how to prevent or avoid a snake bite? No. And what would you do if a snake died?
[00:01:17.340] - Speaker 1
Well, go to the doctor, that's the logical thing to do.
[00:01:21.080] - Speaker 2
Which doctor would you go to?
[00:01:23.610] - Speaker 1
Not to the doctor, the regular doctor, but to the hospital.
[00:01:26.380] - Speaker 2
In Carmen or somewhere else?
[00:01:28.180] - Speaker 1
El Carmen, you would arrive at Carmen, and I think they are moving Carmen to another municipality.
[00:01:33.910] - Speaker 2
So, would you trust the hospital, in Carmen, to cure a snake bite?
[00:01:39.830] - Speaker 1
In that case, the closest place to go is there. One would have to place one's trust in them.
[00:01:48.960] - Speaker 2
And where do you feel most likely to be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:01:57.600] - Speaker 1
In the countryside.
[00:01:58.590] - Speaker 2
Why?
[00:01:59.640] - Speaker 1
Because it is more wooded, there is much more grass and more mountains.
[00:02:04.290] - Speaker 2
And can you tell poisonous snakes from non-poisonous ones? No. It's difficult, yes. And do you know of any cases of snake bites?
[00:02:17.190] - Speaker 1
No, not yet.
[00:02:18.310] - Speaker 2
And if you need to go to the hospital, is that difficult for you or easy?
[00:02:25.910] - Speaker 1
It's very difficult for me because I'm a foreigner and I don't have legal documentation here in the country.
[00:02:32.440] - Speaker 2
Yes, okay, sure. Well, I don't have any more questions, but do you have anything else to say about snakes or your knowledge of snakes or anything else?
[00:02:45.670] - Speaker 1
No, I don't know any more. I don't know anything about her.
[00:02:48.390] - Speaker 2
And well, important information. After a snake bite, it's important to go straight to the hospital. And it's important to know what kind of snake bit you, because there are different antivenoms for different snakes, and you can take a picture of the snake or you can kill it and take it to the hospital. And it's important to go to the hospital because antivenom is the only solution for a snake bite from a poisonous snake. And yes, that's the information I have. But thank you very much, I don't have any more. Always at your service. Thank you very much.
