[00:00:00.750] - Speaker 2
What's it called? Thanks. And what's your name?
[00:00:03.280] - Speaker 1
My name is Juan Mauricio González.
[00:00:06.000] - Speaker 2
And how old are you?
[00:00:07.170] - Speaker 1
Thirty-five.
[00:00:08.880] - Speaker 2
And what do you do for a living?
[00:00:10.390] - Speaker 1
Right now, I work here taking care of the lake. We work with the municipal water company, Aguas. We are responsible for the lake. Interesting. We are the ones who tell people not to litter, to keep the place clean, because over time this will become part of the town's water system.
[00:00:38.120] - Speaker 2
That's water for the people.
[00:00:46.410] - Speaker 1
Yes, they do. At the moment, it hasn't started working yet, but yes, that's the idea.
[00:00:55.530] - Speaker 2
Interesting. Are you married or in a civil union? Do you have children?
[00:01:03.920] - Speaker 1
Yes, I have one, and there will be two.
[00:01:07.770] - Speaker 2
And how many years have you lived in Carmen?
[00:01:12.010] - Speaker 1
Well, my whole life. I lived until I was 18. I went into the army to serve. I continued as a professional soldier, stepped on a mine, and now I have a prosthetic leg. As you can see, I stepped on a mine and lost a leg. From there, I lived in Medellín for five years, and then I came back to live here in Carmo. And so, do you think And why is it likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here? Well, here, in this place, around here, there are a lot of X-type snakes. When we first arrived here, while we were clearing the land, we always found a lot of Zapa snakes, which are the same as the X-type, right? And there we killed quite a few.
[00:02:09.870] - Speaker 2
Yes, of course. And have any of your animals been bitten by a snake, such as a pet or a canary?
[00:02:17.790] - Speaker 1
No, not so far, thank God.
[00:02:21.970] - Speaker 2
And do you know how to prevent or avoid a snake bite?
[00:02:28.380] - Speaker 1
I think that when you spend so much time in that environment, you're likely to encounter them, because they tend to stay in those places. When you see them, you kill them or see what you can do, but don't get too close, because it's dangerous if they bite you, right? So, you try to avoid them. For example, I see a snake and I know them very well, so I see if it's poisonous or not. If it's not poisonous, I don't kill it. If it is poisonous, I do try to kill it, because that is its instinct, yes. Similarly, if you don't bother them, they won't do anything to you. But likewise, when you don't see them and suddenly step on one, they will attack you. So, that's what you think as a human being, even though you shouldn't do that.
[00:03:31.740] - Speaker 2
Yes, okay. Well, what would you do if a snake bit you?
[00:03:38.290] - Speaker 1
Well, the truth is, being bitten, here, for example, the first thing you have to do is They often say you have to catch the snake, take it to the place where they'll give you the antivenom so they know what kind of snake it is and can give you the right antivenom.
[00:04:10.160] - Speaker 2
And then you would go to the hospital?
[00:04:13.210] - Speaker 1
Yes, it's also the most necessary thing, because that's where they give you the antivenom, which is what saves you, depending also on where the snake bites you. And the most likely thing you have to do is go to a hospital or somewhere that can treat you.
[00:04:37.420] - Speaker 2
Would you go to the hospital in Carmen or to another hospital?
[00:04:40.050] - Speaker 1
I think so, and I believe that's where they send them. I've heard of several cases here where people have been bitten by snakes and taken there, and then they're sent to different places where they have antivenom.
[00:04:54.290] - Speaker 2
And where do you feel most likely to be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:05:03.890] - Speaker 1
Well, that also depends on where you live. Yes. In the village, although there are also snakes in the village, because when it's hot here, they look for cool places, just like here. When it's very hot in summer, they look for the banks of lakes and streams. So, snakes can get you, because, like I said, they're everywhere. But you're more likely to get bitten by a snake in these places than in your house. In your house, it's very rare that you'd suddenly get bitten by a dangerous snake.
[00:05:46.750] - Speaker 2
And do you know how to identify poisonous and non-poisonous snakes?
[00:05:51.720] - Speaker 1
Yes, I have a rough idea of which ones are poisonous and which ones aren't, as I was saying.
[00:05:59.020] - Speaker 2
Yes, to kill or not to kill.
[00:06:00.460] - Speaker 1
Or whether you can kill them or not. For example, I don't kill the ones that aren't poisonous. But if they are poisonous, if I can, I kill them.
[00:06:11.530] - Speaker 2
And how do you identify different snakes?
[00:06:15.180] - Speaker 1
Well, many people know poisonous snakes by the shape of their heads, which are like little padlocks, and by their size and so on. For example, around here, there are poisonous snakes of size X. If I go over there, there are lots of rattles. The rattles are the little things they have. Coral. Yes, coral. But there's also false coral, yes. The real thing is still there. I mean, there's real coral and false coral. So, now you know more or less. For example, there's one here called la pudridora, which bites you and makes you rot, that's why it's called pudriora. So, you kind of know them. For example, there are some that stay over there without sticks, which were given away when they were green, they're called bejucas, and they don't do anything. For example, there are some that are similar to tallas, which are also the same color, they were used as sabaneras, but they're not dangerous either.
[00:07:27.780] - Speaker 2
Yes, it's difficult, there are false ones and there are real ones. And do you know of a case of a snake bruise?
[00:07:36.690] - Speaker 1
Recently, a man was bitten by a snake, and due to negligence here at the hospital, they didn't remove it quickly and almost had to amputate his leg because it got infected. I think it was a snake with a venomous bite. That man from Yes, I think he was bitten by a snake. Javier? What's his name? The one who was in front of the school, right? Yes. The one from the tejo courts. When could you give it to the weirdest girl, because she's got the anti-mosquito spray, and she's got a little rain on her too. Uh-huh.
[00:08:20.440] - Speaker 2
Yes. And if you need to go to the hospital, is that difficult for you or easy?
[00:08:28.040] - Speaker 1
It depends. If you have transportation and everything, it's faster, but if not, for example, when there is no transportation, it's more complicated. With transportation, you can get there faster to be treated and everything for an emergency like that. But if there is no transportation, it's more complicated. Because anyway, when a case like that happens, you have to be there immediately. The faster, the better for you. If you delay, there will be complications.
[00:09:04.980] - Speaker 2
Yes. Well, I don't have any more questions, but do you have anything else to say about snakes or your knowledge?
[00:09:12.160] - Speaker 1
No.
[00:09:13.570] - Speaker 2
Right? Okay, good. And the most important thing to remember after a snake bite is to go to the hospital immediately. It's important to know what kind of snake bit you, because there are different antivenoms for different snakes. You can take a picture of the snake, kill it, and take it to the hospital.
[00:09:36.220] - Speaker 1
And take it with you, yes. That's what people usually do. If the snake bites you, try to kill it and take it with you.
[00:09:45.220] - Speaker 2
Yes, exactly. Well, thank you very much for your time. Okay. Very kind of you. Thank you. Okay. Nice to meet you.
