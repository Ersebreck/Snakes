[00:00:06.740] - Speaker 1
And what do you do for a living?
[00:00:09.310] - Speaker 2
I work here.
[00:00:11.940] - Speaker 1
Are you married or single? Married. Do you have children?
[00:00:16.920] - Speaker 2
Yes.
[00:00:18.440] - Speaker 1
And how many years have you lived in Carmen? How many years?
[00:00:24.150] - Speaker 2
Eleven years.
[00:00:27.640] - Speaker 1
So, do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:32.090] - Speaker 2
Yes, of course. You're never safe from anything, from any animal.
[00:00:37.210] - Speaker 1
My boots saved me.
[00:00:38.370] - Speaker 2
Yeah, these boots saved me one day while I was playing.
[00:00:42.360] - Speaker 1
And have any of your animals ever been bitten by a snake, a pet, or livestock?
[00:00:49.940] - Speaker 2
No, not here on the farm. I was bitten once, but that was when I was little, around 12 years old.
[00:00:58.320] - Speaker 1
And do you know how to prevent or avoid a snake bite? Well, to be honest, I have no idea.
[00:01:04.700] - Speaker 2
They say that sometimes when a snake bites you, if there's oil, the kind that makes you fart, you put a strip of that on it. And what would you do if a snake bit you? How can you avoid it? I have no idea. They say that sometimes when a snake bites you, if there's oil, the kind that makes you fart, you put a strip of that on it.
[00:01:25.380] - Speaker 1
And what would you do if a snake bit you?
[00:01:30.140] - Speaker 2
Once the mixture is ready, you avoid tying a strip from the top, which is dirty with gasoline or oil, because they say that this prevents the poison from working as well on the upper part of the body. And you have a chance of reaching the doctors.
[00:01:49.670] - Speaker 1
Would you go to the hospital?
[00:01:52.490] - Speaker 2
Yes, to a hospital, because there were very few healers, and healers weren't well respected. Because before, there used to be healers who would treat snake bites, and people would say, "Well, there's a healer in such-and-such a place," and they would take the bite victim there. And the healer would know before the victim arrived that they were coming to see him, because there weren't many people who knew much about these things.
[00:02:15.430] - Speaker 1
Is there a healer here in Carmen?
[00:02:18.480] - Speaker 2
No, we haven't heard anything about it here.
[00:02:22.380] - Speaker 1
Would you go to the hospital in Carmen or somewhere else?
[00:02:29.480] - Speaker 2
First of all, I really think that here in Carmen, it would be like first aid. There, the doctors would at least tell us where to go, whether to send him to the spinal unit or to Yoke, or somewhere else.
[00:02:41.010] - Speaker 1
And if you need to go to the hospital, is that difficult for you or easy?
[00:02:48.970] - Speaker 2
Well, as long as you can move, because if the snake is very poisonous, don't give it the satisfaction of letting you get away. Call an ambulance. Everyone should call an ambulance and wait for someone to arrive, something. Yes.
[00:03:03.930] - Speaker 1
But from here, is it easy to get to the hospital?
[00:03:10.370] - Speaker 2
It's not that easy, because sometimes you call, at least to call an ambulance, and they tell you it will take a while to get there. Or sometimes they're not in Carmen, they're somewhere else. So while you're waiting for the ambulance to come, at least to Carmen to pick you up, suddenly you might be in worse shape.
[00:03:32.600] - Speaker 1
And do you know how to identify poisonous snakes from non-poisonous ones?
[00:03:37.790] - Speaker 2
No.
[00:03:39.580] - Speaker 1
And do you know of any cases of snake bites? Not around here. No. Well, I don't have any more questions, but do you have anything else to say about snakes, your knowledge of snakes, or anything else?
[00:04:00.610] - Speaker 2
There are many kinds of snakes, as I mentioned earlier. The one we killed there was a candelilla, but then you said it wasn't poisonous. And there's the coral snake, the one with the little stripes like that, there's the Mapaná X, and there's the one called mapana prieta, which is AX, and there's the white mapana, which is even more dangerous than that one. And there are many kinds of snakes.
[00:04:32.650] - Speaker 1
Yes, many. And here, in this part, the chorus, the carving, and the bells are the most poisonous. The most poisonous.
[00:04:43.950] - Speaker 2
They say that you have to see it to believe it around here, but I haven't come across one yet. They say there are some, but they're small houses, although the one they've found is supposed to be big.
[00:04:57.630] - Speaker 1
And it's important to know that after a snake bite, you should go straight to the hospital. And it's important to know what kind of snake bit you, because there are different antivenoms for different snakes. You can take a picture of the snake or you can kill it and take it to the hospital. And that's the most important thing to know.
[00:05:27.970] - Speaker 2
Yes, that's right.
[00:05:29.660] - Speaker 1
But, well, that's all I have. Thank you very much for your time.
[00:05:33.310] - Speaker 2
Always the order.
[00:05:35.360] - Speaker 1
Yes, thank you. Very kind. It's my pleasure.
