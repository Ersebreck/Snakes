[00:00:09.040] - Speaker 1
And what do you do for a living?
[00:00:12.050] - Speaker 2
Various options.
[00:00:12.970] - Speaker 1
Are you married or single?
[00:00:16.820] - Speaker 2
Single. Do you have children? No.
[00:00:21.730] - Speaker 1
And how many years have you lived in Carmen?
[00:00:24.750] - Speaker 2
All my life. Since I was a month old, still up in the jungle.
[00:00:29.930] - Speaker 1
So you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:34.710] - Speaker 2
Well, I think so, because we're fed up. We're always fed up with the mountains, we cross them a lot.
[00:00:44.070] - Speaker 1
And have any of your animals ever been bitten by a snake, a pet, a channel?
[00:00:50.310] - Speaker 2
No, not here. No? Not living with this woman right now. When we were in Morteño, but the cattle, the cows that were bitten and killed, no.
[00:00:57.290] - Speaker 1
Yes, okay. And do you know how to prevent or avoid a snake bite?
[00:01:04.810] - Speaker 2
How can you avoid being bitten? No, not really. But if not, I don't know how to avoid being bitten. Maybe how to act after being bitten, suddenly yes, but no. No, I can't avoid being bitten by a snake.
[00:01:16.840] - Speaker 1
What would you do if you were bitten by a snake?
[00:01:21.090] - Speaker 2
It's because we've always been hunters, we bring the bile of the borugo. We always have it either dried or in liquid form with a little bit of aguardiente. And those who have tried it say, because I've never done it myself, that it's never happened, that a snake bites someone and you take a little cupful or a spoonful and that at least gives you time to get where you need to go. It gives you more time than you would normally have if you didn't take anything. We don't have anything else.
[00:01:50.590] - Speaker 1
Would you go to the hospital?
[00:01:53.640] - Speaker 2
It's your turn. It's your turn to suffer, but here at Carmen Hospital they don't let you die.
[00:01:59.130] - Speaker 1
With fights in the hospital?
[00:02:00.210] - Speaker 2
Not Del Carmen. Not Del Carmen.
[00:02:02.500] - Speaker 1
Why?
[00:02:03.510] - Speaker 2
Because the doctors are very bad. The care is terrible. Here, you arrive at the town hospital and they leave you to die on the stairs. Here, they don't even bother to turn you over or anything like that. Make sure you have good insurance, because otherwise, that's another problem.
[00:02:16.530] - Speaker 1
Yes. And if you need to go to the hospital, is that difficult for you or easy?
[00:02:22.590] - Speaker 2
Well, to get down from the village, you have your motorcycle, at least that, you go yourself, or someone takes you. Otherwise, to get down, if you don't have to move around here, you're screwed, it's not fair here. We haven't moved here, because there's one person, let's say, the man here who has the car button, but he doesn't have it. Tulio's brother-in-law, that's an emergency, but if he's around during the day, yes, at night, there's no one here to help him with anything. It's complicated, it's complicated here. Yes, of course.
[00:02:51.550] - Speaker 1
And where do you feel you are most likely to be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:02:56.250] - Speaker 2
At home.
[00:02:57.920] - Speaker 1
Why?
[00:02:58.990] - Speaker 2
Because, let's say, at a time like this, they really seek the warmth of the house, to get us to cook for them and stuff. Whereas out in the mountains, you know, you're watching out for them looking for rotten leaves to keep warm, which are worthless. Whereas at home you can move a piece of wood, something, and suddenly it's there under your feet and she bites it. They're more likely to bite you at home than in the mountains. Here, that's the truth.
[00:03:23.020] - Speaker 1
It's true, yes, it's true. And do you know how to tell if a snake is poisonous or non-poisonous?
[00:03:31.180] - Speaker 2
More or less. More or less. I don't have specific knowledge about all of them, but yes More or less, we sort them by the shape of the head, because the fighting bull, to tell you the truth, has a head shaped like a padlock. It's not like that, it's flatter, the head is rounder. And well, let's say here that you know size X, because it has the X on top and the head, but there are many different sizes, not just one. Here I've seen about three different ones. I've seen the normal little head, which they send out as size ruga, which is small like this. I've seen the one above, which is kind of white, and I've seen a light gray one with yellow here on the side, here on the guard, the yellow mouth. But apart from that, the coral, I don't know which one is the real one and which one isn't. Anyway, I have no idea which ones they are. I've seen them, but I haven't identified them because...
[00:04:23.320] - Speaker 2
There are fakes, yes, that's true. I've seen red and black ones, red and black and white ones, gray and white ones, all kinds of things.
[00:04:31.850] - Speaker 2
But you take them because they're corals, I don't know what they were.
[00:04:34.460] - Speaker 1
Yes, of course. And do you know of a case of snake helping?
[00:04:43.030] - Speaker 2
My aunt Patricia was bitten a long time ago in the house, right there in the house. She was in the house and, as I said, she went to the laundry room, between dark and light, and moved some damp clothes to the washing machine. And since it was summer, she wanted to cool off with the water from the washing machine, so she reached for it, and it bit her hand. And the other one, Tulio's wife, when the snake bit her too. An old man upstairs, but that was many years ago, to Don Ramón Romero. Years ago, we lived upstairs, back when we were still on the farm. It saved him, he was very drunk, too drunk. So, the alcohol he always had in his body made him freeze up The man left, halfway up the hill when the snake bit him, he kept going towards the house. They wanted to take him to the botilla house where they used to treat people back then, there was still petroleum, they gave him petroleum to drink.
[00:05:37.408] - Speaker 2
Until the next morning, they went back down to the hospital, and for now they took him out, they gave him a lot of medicine to change or remove the clots that had formed in his vein and they drained a lot of blood, but he almost bit my hand, he saved his bones, he was very drunk.
[00:05:56.540] - Speaker 1
I have no further questions. Do you have any more? What about snakes, your knowledge of snakes? Anything else to add?
[00:06:06.330] - Speaker 2
No, I mean, the only thing I'm still unsure about is what I told you about the choruses. There are a lot of people who are fake and who were real, but I'm still not sure which ones are which. I have no idea about that.
[00:06:23.180] - Speaker 1
It's difficult, yes. There are many fakes here, and there are many real ones too, and it's difficult to identify the different ones. But when It's important to know the ancillos of the snake in the corals. If the ancillos are all over the body, it's more likely to be a real one. If the ancillos are not all over, it's a fake for the corals. And yes, there are other methods, but I'm not an expert in being faithful. No, not that.
[00:07:15.090] - Speaker 2
But it is important to know that after a snake bite, you should go to the hospital immediately and it is important to know what kind of snake bit you, because there are different antivenoms for different snakes. You can take a photo of the snake or kill it and take it to the hospital.
[00:07:41.290] - Speaker 1
And yes, that's the most important thing to know.
[00:07:44.680] - Speaker 2
Yes, it was one person's turn to bring a photo or carry it as such, because there is a different antivenom serum for each different snake.
[00:07:52.710] - Speaker 1
Exactly, yes, exactly.
[00:07:54.120] - Speaker 2
That's right, yes. They are different. Yes.
[00:07:58.540] - Speaker 1
But thank you very much. Okay, that's all I have. Very kind of you.
[00:08:02.060] - Speaker 2
No, don't worry.
