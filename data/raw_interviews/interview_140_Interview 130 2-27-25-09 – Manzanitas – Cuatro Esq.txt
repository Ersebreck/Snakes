So, do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:40.530] - Speaker 2
Of course there are. Why? Because there are. Because they could show up here at any moment.
[00:00:48.480] - Speaker 1
And have any of your animals been bitten by a snake, like a pet or a dog? No. And do you know how to prevent snake bites? Prevent them? Right.
[00:01:05.120] - Speaker 2
Well, you always have to be careful, right? Of course. You look to see where they might be and then when you pick something up, you have to be careful.
[00:01:15.850] - Speaker 1
Yes, of course. And what would you do if a snake died? What would you do? What would you do if a snake bit you?
[00:01:27.140] - Speaker 2
Well, first see what kind of snake it is. Obviously, because then we'll know what antidote to use. Go to the doctor immediately.
[00:01:36.260] - Speaker 1
Yes. Which doctor would you go to? In Carmen or somewhere else?
[00:01:44.770] - Speaker 2
It depends on how I feel, because if it's an emergency, an urgent matter, I'll go there because it's an emergency, first aid that I need to get, otherwise I wouldn't go anywhere else.
[00:01:58.450] - Speaker 1
And where do you feel you are most likely to be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:02:08.970] - Speaker 2
At home, because I live here and I don't have any other plans. I mean, I'm broke. And do you know how to tell if a snake is poisonous or not?
[00:02:23.780] - Speaker 1
Yes, it's difficult.
[00:02:25.090] - Speaker 2
And I'm afraid of all of them. Even if they're not poisonous, when they're not poisonous, I get it, I understand.
[00:02:32.570] - Speaker 1
And do you know of any cases of snake bites?
[00:02:36.980] - Speaker 2
A thousand. If you need to go to the hospital, is it difficult for you or is it easy? No, easy.
[00:02:48.230] - Speaker 1
And, well, I don't have any more questions, but do you have anything else to say about snakes or your knowledge or anything else about snakes? No. And you already know, but for a snake bite, it's important to go straight to the hospital after a snake bite. And it's important to know what kind of snake bit you, because there are different antivenoms for different snakes. And you can take a picture of the snake or you can kill it and take it to the hospital. But you already know that, I think. But anyway, I don't have anything else. Thank you very much, very kind of you. Thank you very much.
