How many years have you lived in Carmen, here?
[00:00:29.180] - Speaker 2
Here in Carmen? I've always lived here, in Toliva, in Carmen. Of course. Or in Tai, same thing. Okay. And here.
[00:00:40.180] - Speaker 1
So, do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake? And are there people around here?
[00:00:45.420] - Speaker 2
Well, yes, because you always find one or two here and there.
[00:00:49.390] - Speaker 1
Yes, okay. Have any of your animals been bitten by a snake, such as a pet or livestock?
[00:00:58.560] - Speaker 2
A cow, yes, close to home, but not ours, the neighbors'.
[00:01:02.900] - Speaker 1
And do you know how to prevent or avoid a snake bite? No. What would you do if a snake bit you? And where?
[00:01:15.860] - Speaker 2
Find a hospital as soon as possible where they can put me on an IV.
[00:01:22.030] - Speaker 1
Sure.
[00:01:22.230] - Speaker 2
Put one on me.
[00:01:24.150] - Speaker 1
And which hospital is closest to you?
[00:01:26.800] - Speaker 2
Where I live, the one from Kundai.
[00:01:29.160] - Speaker 1
From Kundai. Not in Carmen, not the hospital. And would you trust the hospital in Kundai to treat a snake bite?
[00:01:40.790] - Speaker 2
No.
[00:01:41.260] - Speaker 1
Why?
[00:01:41.520] - Speaker 2
Because I don't think they can give us the care we need. Come on
[00:01:49.600] - Speaker 1
Or your spine suddenly. And if you need to go to the hospital, is that difficult for you or easy? Difficult. Why?
[00:02:00.290] - Speaker 2
Because I have it here in this wheelchair. Because of my health insurance, they lend me the wheelchair service.
[00:02:07.850] - Speaker 1
And where do you feel you are most likely to be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:02:17.700] - Speaker 2
In the countryside, Mom.
[00:02:19.230] - Speaker 1
Okay, why?
[00:02:20.880] - Speaker 2
Well, because it's all mountains and there are lots of mountains, they always ride them.
[00:02:25.940] - Speaker 1
Sure, yes, of course.
[00:02:27.440] - Speaker 2
And always, sometimes, you go down the road and you find all that stuff, but I don't know.
[00:02:33.470] - Speaker 1
And can you tell if snakes are poisonous or venomous? No. And do you know of any cases of snake bites?
[00:02:47.930] - Speaker 2
Not over there.
[00:02:50.340] - Speaker 1
No, okay. Well, I don't have any more questions, but do you have anything else to say about snakes or your knowledge of snakes or anything else?
[00:03:02.150] - Speaker 2
Well, the only thing over there in the village is size X.
[00:03:06.920] - Speaker 1
Yes.
[00:03:07.780] - Speaker 2
That's what you find most there. And sometimes you also find Coral.
[00:03:12.860] - Speaker 1
And bells too, yes.
[00:03:16.540] - Speaker 2
Yes, size X, as they call it, and Coral. Yes.
[00:03:19.780] - Speaker 1
And the most important information is that after a snake bite that causes you to cry, it is important to go straight to the hospital and it is important to know what kind of snake bit you, because there are different antivenoms for different snakes.
[00:03:39.520] - Speaker 2
Not everything works.
[00:03:41.280] - Speaker 1
Yes. And you can take a picture of the snake or you can kill it and take it to the hospital. But that's what's most important. But that's all I have. Thank you very much for your time. You're welcome.
