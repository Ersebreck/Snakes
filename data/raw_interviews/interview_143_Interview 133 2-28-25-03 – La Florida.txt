[00:00:00.000] - Speaker 2
What's your name?
[00:00:01.910] - Speaker 1
Marta Llané, Corrales, Montiales.
[00:00:04.040] - Speaker 2
And how old are you?
[00:00:06.160] - Speaker 1
I am currently 45 years old.
[00:00:08.250] - Speaker 2
And what do you do for a living?
[00:00:09.820] - Speaker 1
I am completely independent.
[00:00:12.250] - Speaker 2
Are you married or single? I'm single, with no children. How many years have you lived in El Carmen?
[00:00:19.260] - Speaker 1
Four years ago.
[00:00:21.990] - Speaker 2
So, do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:26.040] - Speaker 1
I think so.
[00:00:27.020] - Speaker 2
Why?
[00:00:28.140] - Speaker 1
Because if someone gets stung and there's no one around to help them, then yes. That's true.
[00:00:32.690] - Speaker 2
And have any of your animals ever been bitten by a snake, like a pet? No. No? None. And do you know how to prevent or avoid a snake bite? No, ma'am. What would you do if a snake bit you?
[00:00:47.380] - Speaker 1
Well, I'd be alone, I don't know what to do. Yes, okay. I couldn't say.
[00:00:51.930] - Speaker 2
Would you go to the hospital after a snake bite?
[00:00:56.410] - Speaker 1
With those hospitals here, I don't think so. With the state of healthcare we have now, it's impossible.
[00:01:01.650] - Speaker 2
Wouldn't you trust the hospital in Carmen to cure a bite?
[00:01:05.260] - Speaker 1
I don't think so.
[00:01:07.010] - Speaker 2
But would you trust other hospitals to treat a snake bite?
[00:01:11.270] - Speaker 1
Well, as you see on television, they make an X here and suck out the blood and the lenses while they carry you away, depending on the snake's venom.
[00:01:22.280] - Speaker 2
Would you go to other hospitals such as Gerardot, Espinard, or others?
[00:01:28.020] - Speaker 1
Yes, because I have a medicine prepared that is colzane.
[00:01:31.220] - Speaker 2
And where do you feel you are most likely to be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:01:40.520] - Speaker 1
Well, I think that wherever the snake goes, whether it's in the city or here, it's the same.
[00:01:46.230] - Speaker 2
And do you know how to tell if a snake is poisonous or venomous? No, I have no idea. It's difficult. And do you know of any cases of snake bites?
[00:01:57.250] - Speaker 1
No.
[00:01:58.190] - Speaker 2
What if you need to go to the hospital? Is that difficult or easy for you?
[00:02:02.420] - Speaker 1
Well, what happens is that here, for example, I have to call a motorcycle taxi.
[00:02:05.800] - Speaker 2
Okay. That's easy, more or less. No. Okay, that's easy, more or less. And I don't have any more questions, but do you have anything else to say about snakes, your knowledge, about performance, about snakes, anything else?
[00:02:16.490] - Speaker 1
No, there are very few snakes here, there aren't any. Okay, good. Well, I have seen some that are kind of greenish, brownish, but they just pass by here and there, but that's not
[00:02:27.960] - Speaker 2
Okay, fine.
[00:02:28.990] - Speaker 1
And in summer they go in there like They take refuge there in summer. When it's really hot, they do go under the bushes. But I don't think there are that many here. I think there are in the jungle, but not here, right?
[00:02:41.730] - Speaker 2
Sure.
[00:02:42.790] - Speaker 1
They still eat it there, don't they?
[00:02:44.200] - Speaker 2
Yes, yes.
[00:02:46.380] - Speaker 1
Well, now that we've done this interview, why do you do this?
[00:02:51.390] - Speaker 2
Because I want to understand more about the knowledge of the people here. I have two colleagues in the Andes who are experts in snakes.
[00:03:01.780] - Speaker 1
Where are you from?
[00:03:03.150] - Speaker 2
United States.
[00:03:05.080] - Speaker 1
You are American.
[00:03:07.150] - Speaker 2
Yes, exactly.
[00:03:08.380] - Speaker 1
Did you settle here or do you live in North America? Or do you live in the United States?
[00:03:12.860] - Speaker 2
No, I live here in Colombia now, but I'm going back to the United States in six months.
[00:03:21.960] - Speaker 1
How much turmoil is there now?
[00:03:25.020] - Speaker 2
And I also have some important information: after a snake bite, it is important to go straight to the hospital. And it is important to know what kind of snake bit you, because different snakes have different physical characteristics.
[00:03:46.680] - Speaker 1
But they speak Spanish very well, because you're very American.
[00:03:49.270] - Speaker 2
Thank you. I'm practicing my Spanish right now.
[00:03:53.610] - Speaker 1
Is it easier to learn Spanish or English?
[00:03:56.230] - Speaker 2
I don't know, because I speak English.
[00:03:59.000] - Speaker 1
But in English, no, no, no, no, no, nothing to do with it.
[00:04:01.650] - Speaker 2
I don't know. Both are difficult, but maybe English is more difficult, I don't know, because I speak English, I don't know any more. But yes.
[00:04:13.670] - Speaker 1
But she speaks Spanish very well, she could be American.
[00:04:16.380] - Speaker 2
Thank you. And yes, yes. If you need to take a photo of the snake after the snake bite, that's fine, or you can kill it and take it to the hospital. But that's what's most important. But yes, thank you very much for your time. No, no, no. All right.
[00:04:38.640] - Speaker 1
Thank you very much, ma'am.
