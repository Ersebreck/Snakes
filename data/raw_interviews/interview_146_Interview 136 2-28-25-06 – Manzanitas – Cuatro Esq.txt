And how many years have you lived in El Carmen?
[00:00:31.450] - Speaker 1
All my life. I've left and come back, so I've always been here. I come and go. Now I'm always here.
[00:00:39.780] - Speaker 2
So, do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here? I think so. Why?
[00:00:47.370] - Speaker 1
Because you always find them lying around.
[00:00:50.930] - Speaker 2
Has any of your animals ever been bitten by a snake, a pet, livestock, or something else? No. And do you know how to prevent or avoid a snake bite?
[00:01:05.550] - Speaker 1
How can you prevent it? Be aware, always be on the lookout, right? Yes. And prevent it, always, no. Just be careful not to find the novel, if you happen to see it, don't bother with it, like that. Yes, okay, good.
[00:01:24.750] - Speaker 2
And what would you do if you were bitten by a snake?
[00:01:27.700] - Speaker 1
God forbid, no. At that moment, I don't know why that's bad.
[00:01:34.670] - Speaker 2
Would you go to the hospital or not? Sure, go ahead. Which hospital would you go to?
[00:01:39.500] - Speaker 1
To start with, we'd play the one in Carmen, right?
[00:01:43.530] - Speaker 2
Would you go to the hospital in El Carmen to treat a snake bite?
[00:01:46.880] - Speaker 1
No, someone arrives and they refer them to insurance, yet another insurance company.
[00:01:52.950] - Speaker 2
And what other hospitals are there?
[00:01:57.880] - Speaker 1
Well, suddenly we have perfect health, which is in Girardót, Girardót.
[00:02:05.440] - Speaker 2
And if you need to go to the hospital, is that difficult for you or easy?
[00:02:11.820] - Speaker 1
Well, it's easy because my son is there, my husband is there, there's transportation, you don't arrive alone.
[00:02:18.220] - Speaker 2
And where do you feel you are most likely to be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:02:26.830] - Speaker 1
In the countryside. Why? Because that's where they are most prevalent.
[00:02:31.540] - Speaker 2
And can you tell if snakes are poisonous or venomous? No, I don't know. It's difficult, yes.
[00:02:39.870] - Speaker 1
I don't know them.
[00:02:41.240] - Speaker 2
And do you know of a case of snakebite?
[00:02:44.790] - Speaker 1
No. No. Okay.
[00:02:47.370] - Speaker 2
I don't have any more questions, but you have more to say about snakes or your knowledge of snakes, right? No. The most important information is that after a snake bite, you need to go straight to the hospital. And well, the most important information after a snake bite is what kind of snake bit you, because there are different antivenoms for different snakes. You can take a picture of the snake or you can kill it and take it to the hospital. But yeah, I don't have anything else. Thank you very much for your time, very kind of you.
[00:03:21.020] - Speaker 1
Thank you very much.
