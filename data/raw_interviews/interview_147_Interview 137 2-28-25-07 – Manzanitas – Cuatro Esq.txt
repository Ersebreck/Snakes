Here in the municipality, it's been How long? Your whole life. My whole life, because when they brought me here, I was just a newborn, and I've been here for over 60 years, in this village.
[00:01:07.800] - Speaker 1
So, do you think it's likely that you'll be bitten by a snake here?
[00:01:13.650] - Speaker 2
If a snake dies on me, do you think it's likely that you'll be bitten by a snake
[00:01:16.760] - Speaker 1
Do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here?
[00:01:20.820] - Speaker 2
Why? When you kill them, they bite me. When I find them, I kill them all because they scare me.
[00:01:29.800] - Speaker 3
No, you don't kill them, but she says that if a snake bites you, you bite yourself.
[00:01:36.530] - Speaker 2
Yes, if it's a very poisonous snake and he doesn't get it out, there won't be time to get to a hospital. No, they'll see an ambulance and it will kill him.
[00:01:48.830] - Speaker 1
And what would you do if a snake bit you?
[00:01:56.510] - Speaker 2
What if I get bitten by a snake? Or a person. No, if you get bitten. And if it bites me? Yes, if it bites you. Yes. But touch one once it's been removed and go to the emergency room to see a doctor.
[00:02:10.150] - Speaker 1
In El Carmen?
[00:02:12.520] - Speaker 2
To Carmen, to Girardot, to Espinada, to Iván, anywhere. When they attend to him, hurry up. So they can give him that IV drip. Move the bench, move it over there and sit down. He's very tired.
[00:02:29.090] - Speaker 3
Is it difficult or easy for you to go to the hospital if you need to?
[00:02:38.610] - Speaker 2
That they have to take him away quickly on a motorcycle, and suddenly, if they bite him in a place like here, close to the road, which is at least in a jungle, far away, out hunting, at night, it's harder to get home.
[00:03:03.660] - Speaker 1
Do you know how to prevent or avoid a snake bite before a snake bite?
[00:03:12.040] - Speaker 2
How can this be avoided?
[00:03:13.490] - Speaker 1
Yes.
[00:03:15.640] - Speaker 2
Well, you need to have good eyesight and watch the ground carefully. Be careful. Be careful when you're working with a machete or a wire. Sure. And sometimes there are people who like to hunt at night, and they light their way with one of those really good flashlights, and they shine it all over the road and then they arrive. He likes hunting at night. I was attacked by a snake a while ago, but I don't know if it was the shock that made it come out.
[00:03:55.000] - Speaker 1
From a poisonous one?
[00:03:56.370] - Speaker 2
It attacked me here, a size X, but I was over there, a farmer who at that time used a kerosene lamp. He told me to pour kerosene on it because it scratched me a little, but I didn't feel any poison or anything. I got to the house where I was staying and sat down to wait for the pain, but it didn't come. What I took was a spoonful of gorujo gel.
[00:04:24.200] - Speaker 1
Did you go to the hospital or not?
[00:04:26.910] - Speaker 2
No, I didn't go to the hospital. Because I didn't feel any pain, dizziness, or anything.
[00:04:31.630] - Speaker 3
Thank God.
[00:04:33.300] - Speaker 2
Thank God, the Virgin Mary.
[00:04:35.330] - Speaker 1
And where do you feel you are most likely to be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:04:46.090] - Speaker 2
It can even bite you in your own house. She says you can get bitten. It can bite you in your house and in the woods too. If you're working in the woods and you're not paying attention, it can suddenly step on you and attack you. I found a carving and was working on it with a friend when it came out like that, walking, and then it went ahead and waited for us to But we killed it, we were macho.
[00:05:23.430] - Speaker 1
Do you know how to identify poisonous snakes or snakes that are venomous?
[00:05:30.380] - Speaker 2
Yes, which ones are poisonous and which ones aren't?
[00:05:34.340] - Speaker 1
Yes, you know how to identify yourself.
[00:05:36.090] - Speaker 2
The poisonous ones are size X, the coral ones, the chili pepper ones, the ones they call rattlesnakes. There is one called the tortilla, another called the Cazadora. The Cazadora is not poisonous.
[00:05:57.470] - Speaker 1
And how do you identify snakes? By their color, their skin, or something else?
[00:06:05.850] - Speaker 2
Yes, by their color. How do you spot them? By their color. Yes, you can tell more or less what kind of snake it is. There's one called the toche, which is yellow and black. And there's also one called the rabo de ají. The other one, the poisonous one, is called the pudridora. It leaves you rotting. Around there, a man, Mortillo, was bitten on the They had to amputate one of his legs, both legs. I think so. It ate him, it spread like cancer. The snake bite gave him cancer. Sometimes there are a lot of snakes that are very dangerous and poisonous. Yes. There's one called la boba, but that one is a... We call it mitado. That one bites too, but it's not... It's not poisonous. It's not that poisonous because it just makes you drunk.
[00:07:16.750] - Speaker 3
But as they say, now it comes with a stem.
[00:07:21.110] - Speaker 2
There's one they call la zapa, another they call la molá. There it is, the molá snake. One that's short, like the head of the incieta. I got a really big one when I was like that There's one called la mapanada, that's also a word, la mapanada. It hangs its tail from trees and you attack it by the head. Over there, for the time being, most of them are for the coast. For the cesáreo, like for the plains.
[00:08:06.030] - Speaker 1
And do you know of a case of a snake bite? A person?
[00:08:13.520] - Speaker 2
That it bit him. Yes. Here, the one I call Mortiño, he was attacked by a snake. It was probably a pudrídora. It was a pudrídora. Okay, yes. It was like cancer for the man, and his legs gave out. Okay, yes. They amputated his legs. And another woman near Adán Ovillo, also a friend of ours, from the Cernas family, María Cernas, she was also bitten by a small snake, I don't know what kind of snake it was, and she also died about a month after being hospitalized.
[00:08:53.960] - Speaker 3
But we have a doctor's appointment soon.
[00:08:55.850] - Speaker 2
Yes.
[00:08:57.100] - Speaker 1
Well, I don't have any more questions, but do you have anything else to say about snakes or your knowledge of snakes, or anything else?
[00:09:09.400] - Speaker 2
of all the names of the serpent?
[00:09:12.280] - Speaker 1
No, no. Just something else to say about snakes. If you don't have anything else, that's fine.
[00:09:20.700] - Speaker 2
I have to be very careful with animals, because they will attack you.
[00:09:26.290] - Speaker 1
Yes, of course.
[00:09:28.540] - Speaker 2
His wife was bitten. And the snake too. Yes. Luzmila. Luzmila, yes. Over here, almost, thank you. Now, it bit a man up there who was also putting water on it, maybe it attacked me too. But he was saved because they took him to the doctor quickly.
[00:09:52.190] - Speaker 1
Yes, of course.
[00:09:53.800] - Speaker 2
Yes. And there have been cases, but very few.
[00:09:56.660] - Speaker 3
The people from Por Te were stubborn. I wasn't, I was little, I didn't have a face that would attract attention.
[00:10:04.510] - Speaker 2
She was hospitalized. She was hospitalized for over a month.
[00:10:08.440] - Speaker 3
She didn't bring him to the doctor because she didn't want to that night and one of my brothers was drunk. She had a plane, a plane, she had a motorcycle to get to the airport, they packed everything, which really upset you. Not me, I'll take him tomorrow, they arrived tomorrow, but he's already sick like this. You have to be careful, because you have to take care of your health.
[00:10:32.030] - Speaker 2
You're not Colombian?
[00:10:35.320] - Speaker 1
No, I'm from the United States.
[00:10:38.210] - Speaker 2
Are you American? Yes.
[00:10:41.180] - Speaker 1
And I have important information. After a bite from Is she friends with the snake charmers who came here?
[00:10:48.800] - Speaker 2
Yes. Are the snake charmers there?
[00:10:53.090] - Speaker 1
No, not now. But after a snake bite, it's important to go to the hospital, and it's important to know what kind of snake bit you, because there are different antivenoms for different snakes.
[00:11:11.830] - Speaker 2
What about killing them and taking them to the doctor? Exactly.
[00:11:15.420] - Speaker 3
If we can kill her, there was a family of mine, from a very distant country, who arrived and left last night, they left at night with a banana tree and some cacao plants, it was the rank, and a limana bit him on the foot and they didn't know what it was, whether it was a spider or a snake, and they took him to the hospital and gave him whatever they had, whatever they felt like giving him.
[00:11:38.900] - Speaker 2
Or it was a scorpion. It was a big scorpion. Yes, that's what they say about scorpions.
[00:11:43.590] - Speaker 3
Yes. And then he was left dead in the nest.
[00:11:48.560] - Speaker 2
A scorpion, said the woman. And a woman over there also saw it where it stung her When a security guard arrived and saw a scorpion crawling up a friend's leg on the farm, he did this with his hand and put it in his shirt pocket.
[00:12:02.260] - Speaker 3
And then she also to the lady
[00:12:04.070] - Speaker 2
They couldn't find him. A woman, one of those, one of those, one of those, where she was dying, where she was
[00:12:11.840] - Speaker 3
What was his name? One of the man's sons. Every Friday he would pick bananas to send to the village. And the woman, yes, he would cut the bunches and the woman would help him peel them so he could fix them. And the woman came and said, "Hey, aren't you putting your hand under the banana, right on the stem? He's going to hurt the man, when he's going to hurt the man, he'll sting him on the hand. But they didn't think it was a snake, a spider, or a lacana. It got to the silver root button and came out laughing and screaming. They threw her out too, as my mother said, because they took her to the hospital, but they didn't know it was a spider. They brought her a snake and messed her up even more because they couldn't see who
[00:12:52.680] - Speaker 2
Then they took a spider.
[00:12:54.970] - Speaker 3
The first thing they could think of.
[00:12:58.630] - Speaker 2
That's why you have to kill the animal and take it so they can skin it themselves, however they do it. Yes. I went to see what had attacked me, I shot it with a shotgun and it stayed there, but I left because I was scared. And when we went back the next day to look for it, there it was, dead. Yes.
[00:13:20.420] - Speaker 3
Thank God he killed her. She didn't get to drink it. Yes. Let's take two dollars from the stories, because when the junkie drank water
[00:13:29.710] - Speaker 2
So, it's not a bad interview?
[00:13:34.000] - Speaker 1
Yes, but I don't have any more. Thank you very much for your time. Very kind, very interesting.
[00:13:41.790] - Speaker 2
I'm going to eat at McDonald's, they told me. There's a snake called the four noses, which is also what you were talking about.
[00:13:49.900] - Speaker 3
Yes, there is one called bejuca, which is green.
[00:13:58.800] - Speaker 2
But they tell me it's not venomous. It's not venomous, yes. It sticks its tail up your nose and it's going to sting you.
[00:14:03.980] - Speaker 3
There is a snake that is venomous, and there is a snake that is venomous and another that is not venomous.
[00:14:07.970] - Speaker 1
Sure, yes.
[00:14:09.330] - Speaker 2
So, you came to see Carmen, and you said so yourself.
[00:14:12.980] - Speaker 1
What?
[00:14:14.400] - Speaker 3
How do you tell which ones are poisonous and which ones aren't?
[00:14:18.200] - Speaker 1
The carvings, the corals, and the bells. Bells?
[00:14:23.440] - Speaker 3
Yes. And the choir.
[00:14:25.620] - Speaker 1
Yes, and the choir.
[00:14:27.070] - Speaker 2
But there are many who bite it, which we can see.
[00:14:31.280] - Speaker 1
Sure.
[00:14:32.000] - Speaker 3
It's not that dangerous. Yes. He says your services came through.
[00:14:35.740] - Speaker 1
Thank you very much for your time. You're very kind. Have a good day. Thank you.
[00:14:39.230] - Speaker 3
I have to spend a lot of time there.
