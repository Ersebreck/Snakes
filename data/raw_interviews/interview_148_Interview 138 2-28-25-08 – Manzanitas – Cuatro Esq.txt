[00:00:34.480] - Speaker 2
So, do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:38.890] - Speaker 1
Sure, it's very likely that it could if you weren't careful and it could bite you.
[00:00:43.960] - Speaker 2
And have any of your animals been bitten by a snake, such as a pet or livestock?
[00:00:51.840] - Speaker 1
No, not currently.
[00:00:53.480] - Speaker 2
And do you know how to prevent or avoid a snake bite?
[00:00:59.980] - Speaker 1
The most important thing is to remain calm and, above all, make sure you can drink water before the animal falls down.
[00:01:08.590] - Speaker 2
Yes, of course.
[00:01:09.820] - Speaker 1
And stay calm, because the more you panic, the faster you'll feel the effects.
[00:01:17.320] - Speaker 2
Yes, well.
[00:01:18.540] - Speaker 1
Although the effects When I got stung, the effects were... First my tongue hurt, then my vision went blurry, then my brain, my head, my body, everything. I couldn't speak. Then my vision went blurry, I almost...
[00:01:34.220] - Speaker 2
Yes, well. And what would you do if a snake died?
[00:01:41.030] - Speaker 1
Go to the doctor, because what else can you do?
[00:01:44.280] - Speaker 2
And which doctor? Which hospital?
[00:01:46.680] - Speaker 1
The first person to arrive at the town hospital, even though it's not much more than first aid, but anyway, you have to go and see if they can treat you somewhere else.
[00:01:59.470] - Speaker 2
And would you trust the hospital, in Carmen, to cure a snake bite?
[00:02:06.340] - Speaker 1
No, it's not very reliable.
[00:02:07.810] - Speaker 2
Why?
[00:02:09.040] - Speaker 1
Because they don't currently have the necessary medication for that there. It's easier to die there than to get better. That's the truth.
[00:02:19.930] - Speaker 2
And if you need to go to the hospital, is that difficult for you or easy?
[00:02:25.880] - Speaker 1
Well, for me, when I'm feeling good, it's easy, but if I'm feeling bad, it's not going to be very easy. Yes, of course. I have to get help from someone. Yes, of course.
[00:02:36.570] - Speaker 2
And where do you feel you are most likely to be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:02:43.220] - Speaker 1
It's also likely in the countryside and at home, because I've even killed them inside the living room, Corales. And I've killed others called talla molada; there are a lot of talla molada around here.
[00:02:56.560] - Speaker 2
Yes, of course.
[00:02:57.440] - Speaker 1
One is called cabecicándado, it's quite small, with a big head and not very thick. So, it's always around the house and can bite you too.
[00:03:07.680] - Speaker 2
Do you know how to identify poisonous snakes or snakes that are venomous?
[00:03:14.170] - Speaker 1
Most people around here say they're not poisonous, but you have to be careful because you don't know them well. They say that the coral snake isn't dangerous, that it doesn't bite, but that's not true. But which one bites? It has to be dangerous, because then
[00:03:32.420] - Speaker 2
I'm sorry, how were they?
[00:03:36.390] - Speaker 1
What should I tell him? No, I don't trust snakes anyway, because they all bite. If it bites for half an hour, how could a snake that was open not bite?
[00:03:48.220] - Speaker 2
And how do you identify the different snakes? By their color, by
[00:03:52.210] - Speaker 1
Because of the color, because of the looks.
[00:03:55.900] - Speaker 2
And do you know of any cases of snake bites?
[00:04:00.160] - Speaker 1
Most of the cases I know of, at least up there in the hills, involved a woman who died from a bite. But she was known because she was very small, and it turns out that the smaller they are, the more lethal they are. It could be. And they left her there overnight, and she died. She was in the hospital for about 20 days, but she died anyway because she swelled up and became inflamed. It attacks the system right away, the blood and everything, it makes the blood foam. And if you don't know how to treat it, you can't give them the right medicine. And if you give them the wrong medicine, they can make them worse, they told me.
[00:04:40.900] - Speaker 2
Yes, it is important after a snake bite to go to the hospital. And it is important to know what kind of snake bit you, because there are different antivenoms for different snakes. You can take a picture of the snake or you can kill it and take it to the hospital. But that is the most important thing.
[00:05:06.020] - Speaker 1
The most important thing, yes. It bit me, and I didn't know what it was. Over there in the mountains, a man who lived there left it with me, and he bit it with a .24 caliber rifle, and it bit him. It bit me here, on the edge of my mouth. But I went to him, and he was in the mountains, and he gave me some water. They took water from a stick that was already scratched, and that cleared my vision, and I was able to get out of there. They picked me up and took me to the hospital. And there, he took the risk. He was in charge of a man, and he said, "I'll take the risk." They gave me an anti-itch cream, but it was very good because an hour later I was fine. They inject you wherever they find a vein. And they also give you antivenom in the IV. They saved me there, without knowing what kind of snake had bitten me.
[00:05:58.750] - Speaker 2
Yes, that's important, yes.
[00:06:01.810] - Speaker 1
And here, about six months after I had come from up there, from northern Santander, where Don Rosa also bit me, but that one didn't affect me much, because it bit me on the thick part of my finger. I'm sure it didn't inject all the venom, I felt the sting, but no So I took some medicine, a sabina, a double dose, and that was it, it passed. But anyway, you shouldn't trust that. I was there for about 15 days, but the impression I got is that you shouldn't let it worry you, because if you get anxious, it attacks you more easily.
[00:06:40.820] - Speaker 2
And that's all I have, but you have more to say about snakes or your knowledge, anything else to add?
[00:06:47.810] - Speaker 1
No, not at the moment, thank God. What else can I say about that? Only what has happened to me. I have heard about other cases, but I think they have already been mentioned.
[00:07:00.640] - Speaker 2
Well, thank you very much for your time. Very kind of you. Thank you, thank you. All right.
