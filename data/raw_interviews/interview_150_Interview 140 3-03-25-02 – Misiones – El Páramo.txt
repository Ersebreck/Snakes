[00:01:15.880] - Speaker 2
Sure.
[00:01:17.990] - Speaker 1
And have any of your animals been bitten by a snake, such as a pet or livestock?
[00:01:24.830] - Speaker 2
Yes, like cattle, like a man. Yes. Anyone could have done it. But it's time. He was killed by the kicks of a dog. A dog that they send out and set on people.
[00:01:37.560] - Speaker 1
A size?
[00:01:38.370] - Speaker 2
They happen with small animals. And they left because, as I said, not all of them Has it gone up yet? Or is it going up?
[00:01:47.370] - Speaker 1
Yes, it's going up.
[00:01:49.230] - Speaker 2
Up you go, yes, thank you.
[00:01:51.170] - Speaker 1
And do you know how to prevent or avoid a snake bite? Do you know how to prevent or avoid a snake bite? How?
[00:02:04.560] - Speaker 2
Well, I don't know.
[00:02:08.260] - Speaker 1
Or don't you know? Is it okay if you don't know?
[00:02:11.300] - Speaker 2
No, no. No, no. Like you, who understands a little of what he's saying when he explains it to you, he's not telling you anything.
[00:02:22.080] - Speaker 1
Okay. And what would you do if a sea snake bit you?
[00:02:32.030] - Speaker 2
We have to think about how it was.
[00:02:34.840] - Speaker 1
Are you going to the hospital, not going to the hospital, or other methods? What would you do?
[00:02:41.070] - Speaker 2
At home, several times, you have the "Because it's the counter to the culera, yesterday's gorrobo." It's the counter when an animal bites you But you resist letting them take you, but if one bites you and you don't, you die. Depending on the size of the culera, if it's big.
[00:03:04.070] - Speaker 1
Would you go to the hospital too, or would you not go?
[00:03:07.880] - Speaker 2
Yes, things are serious. Because there are snakes that bite you, but then they don't. And for you, is it easy to go to the hospital if you need to, or is it difficult for you? Around here it's difficult. As you can see, there are no ambulances. There is a road, but cars can't get in.
[00:03:30.030] - Speaker 1
It's ugly, yes, of course. But would you trust the hospital in Carmen to treat a snake bite?
[00:03:39.150] - Speaker 2
You know that it will have everything I need for the Carmen process, for the muertedura and the pulvera.
[00:03:47.140] - Speaker 1
And where do you feel most likely to be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:03:55.540] - Speaker 2
In the countryside, yes.
[00:03:57.510] - Speaker 1
Why?
[00:03:59.170] - Speaker 2
Because in the fields where they are, if something bites them, it comes right here to the house.
[00:04:05.590] - Speaker 1
Sure. Can you tell if snakes are poisonous or not?
[00:04:15.260] - Speaker 2
Yes, there are some that are poisonous, like others that aren't very But they give them the study to see which color has the strongest poison.
[00:04:24.980] - Speaker 1
And do you know how to identify snakes? Can you identify snakes? And by their color, or their skin, or their head? By their color, like the rabid ones, which have red heads and tails, and they're very thin.
[00:04:44.360] - Speaker 2
But I did find the culacas submerged, so we took them out more clearly.
[00:04:52.840] - Speaker 1
And do you know of any cases of snake bites?
[00:04:59.890] - Speaker 2
Don't talk to him, or I'll tell him what you said.
[00:05:01.960] - Speaker 1
Well, that's all I have. Do you have anything else to say about snakes or your knowledge? Do you have anything else to add?
[00:05:11.070] - Speaker 2
Yes, we don't know any more than that. Of course, we know everything, but we don't know how How can we check it? You know, I wasn't an engineer at the children's school. Yes.
[00:05:22.870] - Speaker 1
It is important to know that after a snake bite, it is important to go straight to the hospital. That's right. And it is important to know what kind of snake bit you, because there are different antivenoms for different snakes.
[00:05:36.880] - Speaker 2
That's right.
[00:05:39.240] - Speaker 1
You can take a photo of the snake or you can kill it and take it to the hospital.
[00:05:43.940] - Speaker 2
That's right.
[00:05:45.800] - Speaker 1
Yes, but that's what's most important.
[00:05:48.900] - Speaker 2
Yes, of course.
[00:05:50.340] - Speaker 1
But thank you very much. Both of you. Thank you very much.
