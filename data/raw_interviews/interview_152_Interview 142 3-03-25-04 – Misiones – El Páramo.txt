[00:00:01.440] - Speaker 2
And what's your name?
[00:00:03.060] - Speaker 1

[00:00:11.960] - Speaker 2
And what do you do for a living?
[00:00:14.020] - Speaker 1
I work here doing odd jobs on the farm. I'm retired from the army.
[00:00:20.700] - Speaker 2
Are you married or single? Single, for the moment.
[00:00:27.940] - Speaker 1
Separated, happily separated.
[00:00:30.080] - Speaker 2
And how many years have you lived in Carmen?
[00:00:37.230] - Speaker 1
Since I was born. We grew up here first, then we moved to the village. After I turned 18, I went to the village.
[00:00:49.530] - Speaker 2
And do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:54.650] - Speaker 1
Yes, there is a chance, because they are there and you keep working there. Sometimes you come across them, so if you're not careful, you're likely to get bitten.
[00:01:05.270] - Speaker 2
Sure. And have any of your animals ever been bitten by a snake?
[00:01:10.130] - Speaker 1
No, thank God, no.
[00:01:13.350] - Speaker 2
And do you know how to prevent it? And how can you avoid a snake bite?
[00:01:17.830] - Speaker 1
To prevent and avoid them, I think that when you First, when you go out there, look carefully where you are going. And second, when you find them, don't bother them, because if you bother them, they get angry and that's when they attack, because a cerebra, no matter how fierce it is, won't bite you as long as it stays still.
[00:01:35.040] - Speaker 2
Yes, exactly. And what would you do if a snake bit you?
[00:01:41.690] - Speaker 1
If I get bitten by a snake, the first thing I do is look for a hospital.
[00:01:46.560] - Speaker 2
Okay, yes.
[00:01:47.750] - Speaker 1
For example, if you are bitten on the upper part of your body, you hear recommendations that you should apply a bandage to slow down the spread of the poison. Others say that you have to cut yourself so that the poison doesn't spread. But these are things that you usually do. The first thing you should do is look around the village. If there is a way to kill the animal, then yes, you should take it with you to see what kind of snake it is. But the most important thing is to seek first aid in the village or at the hospital.
[00:02:18.770] - Speaker 2
And if you need to go to the hospital, is it difficult or not?
[00:02:25.510] - Speaker 1
No, because if you're here, you have to get there, and by the time you do, the town is already shut down, but during the year I was never here alone either. So, yes, you have access, because there are places where people could die because they are an hour or two away and there is no one to help them, I can say that. That's not complicated, no. But here, thank God, no. Because here there is always a signal or something, so you can go to the town yourself, you have transportation.
[00:02:54.380] - Speaker 2
And would you trust the hospital in Carmen to treat a snake bite?
[00:02:59.440] - Speaker 1
Well, I think that in extreme cases, yes, because once you arrive at the hospital, the most logical thing is for them to give you first aid there. Otherwise, they might not have the old equipment, which they should have, right? But once there, let's say they take you to Gerardo or you have to go to Espinal or somewhere else. So, yes, it's reliable, because if there were no hospital, you wouldn't be reliable, or at least there would be nothing, but yes, right now you can trust the hospital.
[00:03:26.450] - Speaker 2
And where do you feel most likely to be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:03:37.200] - Speaker 1
I think it could be both, because as my brother says, I've sometimes gone out here at night and seen one of them, they're out there. So, it's possible that it could bite him here in the house or out there at work, because you can even find them here, so there are two possibilities, either outside or here in the house, because they come in. Yes, so there are two possibilities.
[00:04:05.800] - Speaker 2
Yes. Do you know how to identify poisonous or venomous snakes?
[00:04:13.650] - Speaker 1
Yes. Generally, I have been taught that poisonous snakes can be recognized by the shape of their head, which is triangular, and their tail, which is thin. The snake that is usually more poisonous is completely smooth. That is what I have been taught, that the snake around here is The X, for example, if you look at its head, it's diamond-shaped. And its face is thin and the tail is thin. The others are thicker, I don't know, this one isn't poisonous, right? For example, the cúlio, the acelermastré or a cazadora, or for example, one that I call a bejuca around here, which is a green snake. The other one. So, we've made something like an egg and a bird.
[00:05:00.300] - Speaker 2
Yes, but she's not poisonous, the baby.
[00:05:03.660] - Speaker 1
They say it's not poisonous, right?
[00:05:08.580] - Speaker 2
And do you know of any cases of serquiente bites, Felipe?
[00:05:16.410] - Speaker 1
Around here, in the region, in the village, yes, because, for example, the last one it bit was this man over there, Felipe. The bull also bit another boy one of these days. Over there, where you went too, a woman was bitten and she died. She was a little girl, but they didn't pay any attention to her, so she died when she was about 15. In the region, let's say, in the village, the whole region, the municipality of Carmen, yes. Here in this area, I can tell you that today a large culera bit someone. But yes, in the region, there have been clear cases. Recently, there in the village, a man was bitten and they almost had to amputate his leg. It was poisonous, supposedly, an X-shaped one with four noses, with rot.
[00:06:10.240] - Speaker 2
Javier or Nuestra?
[00:06:11.930] - Speaker 1
I think so, that's what the man is called, he's from over there in the village.
[00:06:15.610] - Speaker 2
And yes, I have no further questions. Do you have anything else to add?
[00:06:24.730] - Speaker 1
No, anyway, I used to like snakes more, but now I hardly do. No, I'm not addicted to killing them, because they say they also play a part in the ecosystem, right? A function. A function. But if you do, if you do, it's logical that a poisonous snake, you tend not to, you have to kill it because, as a friend said, if I don't kill it, it will kill me.
[00:06:45.900] - Speaker 2
Sure, yes.
[00:06:47.070] - Speaker 1
But let's say, for example, what they are. I don't like to kill them; they're not poisonous, honestly, no.
[00:06:51.790] - Speaker 2
Yes, it is not good to kill non-poisonous snakes, because non-poisonous snakes eat poisonous snakes. Yes.
[00:07:04.140] - Speaker 1
One after the other. Yes.
[00:07:06.760] - Speaker 2
Well, the most important information is, but you already know, after a snake bite, it's important to go straight to the hospital.
[00:07:19.330] - Speaker 1
Yes, of course.
[00:07:20.420] - Speaker 2
And it's important to know which snake killed you, because there are different antivenoms for different snakes. You can take a photo of the snake or you can kill it and take it to the hospital.
[00:07:34.160] - Speaker 1
Yes, that's what they recommend, that's always Well, now with technology you can take a photo, because anyway, arriving at the hospital with a huge snake there...
[00:07:43.860] - Speaker 2
Yes, take off its head, throw away the innards, and goodbye, we're gone. Yes, of course, but yes.
[00:07:50.160] - Speaker 1
And stay calm, because they say we should also stay very calm in a woman's house, because some people get very agitated and that helps more.
[00:07:56.490] - Speaker 2
Yes, it is important.
[00:07:57.450] - Speaker 1
Because, for example, Felipe was bitten by a snake, they say it was thick and big. And it was poisonous, but the man didn't go, and he got to the village and was saved.
[00:08:07.580] - Speaker 2
Tourniquets are also not recommended because
[00:08:13.610] - Speaker 1
Three Sanguerinas.
[00:08:15.390] - Speaker 2
Because blood needs to circulate.
[00:08:19.860] - Speaker 1
You don't do it to stop the bleeding. That's not recommended, not even for snake bites or, say, a gunshot wound, i.e., for bleeding. The thing is, some people apply the tourniquet and leave it like that. You don't have to apply it, but you're loosening it to let the blood flow, because if you leave it tied there for an hour, well, I'm telling you, because when the leg is dead, that's why they let you amputate it. Exactly, yes. So, for us, for example, in the case of For us, for example, in the case of a lesson, they taught us that, just in case, it was always used. Lately, it was like a patch that they put there, they put a liquid on it, and that seals the bleeding. But when you used a tourniquet and it felt like that, you know, you tightened it and came back and asked, "Why am I coming back?" Because if you leave it tight, it's logical that the leg will rot from there to there.
[00:09:08.964] - Speaker 1
So, many times the leg wasn't lost because of the wound, but because of the nurse's lack of knowledge. So, those are all things you learn, right?
[00:09:17.010] - Speaker 1
Yes, exactly.
[00:09:17.810] - Speaker 2
That's important. Okay, great. Thank you very much.
[00:09:24.750] - Speaker 1
Okay, you're on.
