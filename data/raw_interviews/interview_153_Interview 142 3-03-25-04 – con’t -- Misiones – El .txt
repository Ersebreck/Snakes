And at that time, everything came out swollen, he gave away a plumber. Like me, seven times, I haven't done it, seven times I've done it, like me, seven times, and with my other son, the other day, as he was already drunk. But they gave him the poison, but he lasted a while and his whole body was swollen. And as he was drunk, maybe the poison didn't help him as much as it helped But the hole lasted a long time, he was all swollen like that, and now it's gone, because that was a long time ago. I was very young when I came into the house.
[00:00:33.000] - Speaker 2

[00:00:34.710] - Speaker 1
But it's best to avoid one, isn't it?
[00:00:38.890] - Speaker 2
Look carefully. Yes, that's right. Look carefully. Look carefully, avoid getting bitten. Clean the house too. Snakes really like trash and boots in the countryside. Yes.

But when you come jogging, you're bound to run into a rubber boat. No, but I don't understand what you mean.
[00:00:58.370] - Speaker 2
No, but I'm afraid. A little bit, sometimes. Really? Really? Really? Really? Really? Really? Really? Really? Really? Really? I found one once on the road, on the highway. Me too. Sure. I found one once. It's possible.
[00:01:10.570] - Speaker 1
Over there, on the coastal farm. Once I was coming back and there was a girl like that, an X, and I ran her over with my motorcycle and I saw one and I killed her, I thought I had killed her. And I went back to the motorcycle and she was dead, she was all mangled up, she was left like that with the
[00:01:31.200] - Speaker 2
Lisa. Lisa, yes.
[00:01:31.770] - Speaker 1
Of course, because I stepped on it. Wherever it was, I stepped on it with both feet and killed it. But it was like it had just shed its skin, it was always long, it was like this, a little bit longer. And its skin was clean, I swear, it had just shed its skin. But then And then I would have cleaned the skin really well. And you don't dance with it? Because some are kind of blackish, kind of...
[00:01:58.960] - Speaker 2

[00:02:00.220] - Speaker 1
Like coffee, which I love. That one wasn't like No, not yellow, but it was light-colored. But it was okay because it looked fine... Or it could be like they say, that there are several species, right? Sure. Because I've found some, they say it's the male, right? I found some big ones, thick, but short. And there are others that are long. I'm embarrassed that it's long. It's long. But around here, the most common one is that one, the X.
[00:02:32.640] - Speaker 2
Yes, I think it's the X. And I can find the corada too, but the corada
[00:02:36.540] - Speaker 1
And the rotten one too. I also found one there once, a rotten one, it was driving me crazy And why else would it have ended too? The second car too? But the most normal one is that one, the X. It gives me the creeps.
[00:02:51.900] - Speaker 2
Yes, X is the most common, I think. Is your family there? Over there? No.
