Interview 142 3-03-25-04 – con’t -- Misiones – El Páramo
[00:00:00.260] - Speaker 1
It was found there, next to the Paso.
[00:00:01.330] - Speaker 2
Also for the Tolemayda sector, because we found them there.
[00:00:07.330] - Speaker 1
Because it was the highest, driest part, so the rattle is from the driest part. But the rattle isn't that big. But it always grows, there's no rain, if you pick one up, there's no big rattle, it's not a big rattle, but it's loud. It makes a lot of noise. Those snakes have the advantage that when they sense danger, they come to them. Those snakes bite you when the translator is very strong or very bad, and you will always see them or hear them, because they warn you.
[00:00:37.150] - Speaker 2
Yes, it's easier to avoid the shells.
[00:00:40.310] - Speaker 1
Let's say, if you're working and you hear the No, because that snake, wherever you find it, it runs away from you, right? Yes. But the mother goes and runs, stays for a little while, and then goes and hides. Snakes are like that. So you have to keep an eye out. Yes. But not around here. To be honest, since I've been here on this farm, I've found small ones here in this house. Just yesterday I found a small one. But big, big ones, I found one once over there. It was almost as long as it was thick. But the rest you have to look for, I found so many. There are places where you find quite a few. For example, on the sides of the farm there are many, along the edge, on the side of the river. So, you keep working. Then you find up to three or four, but they're small, right? But they're tall. I've found some here too, but I killed one here because it was small when I was with the child.
[00:01:37.313] - Speaker 1
And another one you see there, we killed one over there in the cacotera. Well, I've seen them and they're there, because I'm worried, but they killed one, I mean, they also killed another one.
[00:01:50.600] - Speaker 1
They're always around here, shoot that snake. There are four of them, let's kill two. Someone killed another one for me. We killed two and one here.
[00:02:00.680] - Speaker 2
There are many snakes here, it's incredible. There's one that's black and yellow, we call it toti, who knows what its real name is. Rabo Ají, Rabo.
[00:02:12.690] - Speaker 1
That's Rabo de Ají. No, Rabo de Ají, the one that's spicy at the end too, right?
[00:02:16.880] - Speaker 2
I don't know, I think
[00:02:18.690] - Speaker 1
It is black with white.
[00:02:20.000] - Speaker 2
Black with white and a little yellow too.
[00:02:23.460] - Speaker 1
There are like two species of those there. Those are poisonous. No, that one is already big. The cobra with the stripes is called La cobra. No, not that one, not that one. Not that one. Not that one. That one is similar to the one I'm telling you about. Around here we call it estotil, because it's like That's what grows on vines, yes, but it's... And they also say it's poisonous. That one looks a bit like the... The one that's in Africa, which is the most dangerous, what's it called? The one with the black tongue.
[00:02:53.700] - Speaker 2
I don't know, it's a
[00:02:55.730] - Speaker 1
I remember it was called "snake." When you're over there, man. The black bamba.
[00:02:59.970] - Speaker 2
I don't know. But there are anacondas here in the Amazon.
[00:03:04.010] - Speaker 1
Here, yes, of course. Over there, yes, there are some. They are also found on the plains. But that's because I've found one there that was, let's say, up to 12 meters long. But that's over there, because there are a lot of them over there I mean, why do those snakes need the lake, where do they go? And in the Amazon, well, over there, they live in the river.
[00:03:23.670] - Speaker 2
Didn't you take those days off?
[00:03:26.540] - Speaker 1
Didn't they pick it up?
[00:03:27.860] - Speaker 2
Yes, no, no. But in the plains, yes. She's just doing that interview.
[00:03:32.530] - Speaker 1
But I, for example, traveled through a lot of jungle in Colombia and I never encountered a large snake. And I was in the Bichada, Guaynía, Bauté, Caquetá, and Futumayo regions. And I walked through a lot of jungle. And not to say, "Oh, I found a big snake, like someone who didn't want to tell the story would say. It was when you sat down, you could feel it moving, because it was a snake. Through the palm trees. Never, never. Or a tiger over there that almost knocked him off the tree. Never, not once, did we find a snake, and it was like that. Yes, we would get there, and they were in these huge natural lagoons, and the Indians or the people from around there would tell us to be careful when we got close to those lakes because there were snakes. But they say those animals don't attack you, right? But there were photographs once, some guys had seen it on the river, a big wave, because once the animals are huge and big, they don't attack anyone.
[00:04:37.024] - Speaker 1
But to say that I found one, no, I never, never.
[00:04:40.330] - Speaker 2
They have to be in school. They like to hide, I think.
[00:04:44.060] - Speaker 1
Yes, they mostly stay in the pipes now, in those lagoons. But if you go there, you'll see an animal. But they say they don't attack people, right?
[00:05:02.160] - Speaker 2
I don't think so.
[00:05:02.770] - Speaker 1
For example, what is stupid, all that. But yes, it's enough to start with. It's logical, because they have to hunt by inertia. I have seen videos in the plains, for example, they have a calf there, son of puche, they come and look at it and say: Puche, an animal about six, seven meters long. And in some cases they kill them, because they are dangerous. For example, they say that if you find a poisonous snake and don't want to kill it, then pick it up and take it somewhere else, let's say. For example, up there, there's a farm that belongs to Cortolima, and you can't kill it there Throw it over there. But someone who's really scared is going to pick up a snake in a sack and throw it over there, and it might bite them.
[00:05:42.090] - Speaker 2
The one who has it is the one who has the shotgun, takes out the shotgun, and
[00:05:48.470] - Speaker 1
But the rest don't. And let's say, if you find one, for example, like that lively one I found there, that pernicious one, suddenly you call, let's say, Pisi Lago or Cafán. Haven't you been there? There is one there, look. Thick ones.
[00:06:10.040] - Speaker 2
They don't like it.
[00:06:11.770] - Speaker 1
There's one in Cafán That's an African python. I saw one in Lake Pisi. Yes, there's a big one there too. But there's one in the gallery that's as thick as that in the middle. But they keep it locked up there. And they have all kinds of species there. They say that the African python is kind of blackish there. But the rest, let's say one to call for so they can catch an animal. And besides, an animal, I mean, it has to be in the... Loose, right? Because a little animal is locked up in there. For example, I found that one there, it was wandering around who knows where, it'll be in a cave somewhere. But it was coming around looking for food, because they have to feed themselves. And if they find a chicken? They grab it and see. They eat it for lunch.
[00:07:01.420] - Speaker 2
Yes, just like us.
[00:07:05.000] - Speaker 1
Or a nail, or any animal, because they have to eat, right? If you keep them locked up, you have to feed them chicken, you have to feed them
[00:07:13.340] - Speaker 2
Yes.
[00:07:14.710] - Speaker 1
Sure. That's why in Africa, you guys are like animals, those rows of news passing by above, and there are crocodiles waiting, and there are gazelles, whatever those painted things are called. What do you call them? Zebras.
[00:07:30.220] - Speaker 2
The same, because that's the way it is.
[00:07:34.110] - Speaker 1
One lives, one eats the other, right?
[00:07:37.010] - Speaker 2
Yes.
[00:07:37.880] - Speaker 1
Leopards. Did you see them? Leopards, what leopards? How do they hunt coconuts?
[00:07:43.480] - Speaker 2
The alligator.
[00:07:45.600] - Speaker 1
Yes, in the mountains. What a fierce animal to hunt! I didn't think of such a fierce animal to hunt in the water.
[00:07:51.920] - Speaker 2
Are there alligators here too?
[00:07:55.190] - Speaker 1
No, not around here. You can see a breeding ground down there. Around here there's the babilla. No, it's not similar. I mean, it comes from the same place, but it's smaller. It's a cousin.
[00:08:03.420] - Speaker 2
Yes. Yes, he's a cousin.
[00:08:05.860] - Speaker 1
Last time I found a small one down there. I was traveling, I was there, the creek had already dried up, and I saw the bulls. On which side of the pass did they have a farm with those alligators? What do you call that there? That's called Curaza. Curaza. But the lady who had that farm was caught recently. I don't think she heard the news because she used to sell a lot of those skins there, and they were very expensive. But she had the farm there, and I'm sure she didn't have it legalized, and they caught her for... For smuggling wildlife and all that stuff. And that's why they say they let everything go, if there was no one there, that they opened it up, that they saw a huge pile. But they must have had a lot of it there, to make boots and everything, because you can do a lot with it, and it's expensive because they're bags. Boots, they made boots too. Sure, they make boots, handbags.
[00:09:14.051] - Speaker 1
They're very expensive. Belts.
[00:09:16.650] - Speaker 2
Everything.
[00:09:17.920] - Speaker 1
Well, I'll tell you, it was worth a lot of money. It was a unique handbag worth I don't know how many millions. But since she didn't have it legalized, she had to pay the US for about two years. It wasn't much, but still.
[00:09:33.400] - Speaker 2
Interesting.
[00:09:33.970] - Speaker 1
And that's how they messed it up. They used to say they got rid of those breeding grounds. I don't know how true that was, if they ever existed. But you've seen it, there are tons of those alligators out there. The lady when she was in the bucket.
[00:09:49.570] - Speaker 2
Interesting.
[00:09:55.020] - Speaker 1
Last time, a little girl came here to this lake. And here, where do you have to go to do more interviews? In the town or just on the sidewalks?
[00:10:07.770] - Speaker 2
On all the sidewalks. Yes? Yes.
[00:10:10.750] - Speaker 1
Well, he was here. Did Noillo leave already?
[00:10:13.960] - Speaker 2
Yes, but it's so cute! That chestnut one won't sell.
[00:10:17.310] - Speaker 1
Is there a gas station in town?
[00:10:18.650] - Speaker 2
Peños Blancos. Peños Blancos?
[00:10:21.340] - Speaker 1
Yes. Peños Blancos. Peños Blancos.
