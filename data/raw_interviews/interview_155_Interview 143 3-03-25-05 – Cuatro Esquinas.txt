[00:00:00.640] - Speaker 1
What's your name?
[00:00:01.960] - Speaker 2
Miriam Tavares.
[00:00:03.680] - Speaker 1
And how old are you?
[00:00:07.330] - Speaker 2
65.
[00:00:09.040] - Speaker 1
What do you do for a living? Do you work?
[00:00:11.670] - Speaker 2
Housewife. I'm, let's say, self-employed.
[00:00:17.530] - Speaker 1
Are you married or single? Married. Do you have children?
[00:00:23.260] - Speaker 2
Yes, ma'am.
[00:00:24.570] - Speaker 1
And how many years have you lived in Carmen?
[00:00:28.450] - Speaker 2
In Carmen ya Bueno, I arrived here in Carmen 48 years ago, but we left for a few years and then came back. But here, yes, 48 years since we arrived in this region. Well.
[00:00:44.200] - Speaker 1
So, do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here? Sure. Why?
[00:00:51.070] - Speaker 2
Because you never know when you might come across one of those silly little animals.
[00:00:57.420] - Speaker 1
Yes. And have any of your animals been bitten by a snake, such as a pet or livestock?
[00:01:06.390] - Speaker 2
No, ma'am. No? No. Thank God, hardly any here. Thank God, yes.
[00:01:12.190] - Speaker 1
And do you know how to prevent or avoid a snake bite?
[00:01:17.180] - Speaker 2
Well, not really. Because, practically speaking, you always remain, let's say, the homemaker, who rushes to help, who doesn't, who applies a tourniquet to prevent the poison from spreading, but it's also rushing to find medical services for the antidote and everything else. Because it already happened to us with a relative who was bitten and they took her to El Carmen and didn't pay much attention to her.
[00:01:45.880] - Speaker 1
In El Carmen.
[00:01:47.220] - Speaker 2
Yes, she has for a long time. She was robust.
[00:01:50.970] - Speaker 1
And he went to another hospital?
[00:01:53.320] - Speaker 2
No, right there, because they took her away, and no, it was nothing. Supposedly, no, it was just nerves. And they brought her back, and when she got here, she went back and lost consciousness, and they took her away. She was bitten by a snake, she was very small. But she was left with the effects of the poison. She was sick for a long time because the poison remained in her system, and it killed her platelets. She developed chronic anemia, and that's what killed her.
[00:02:24.970] - Speaker 1
And what does he say? But he got the anti-chips. Yes, that's right.
[00:02:29.860] - Speaker 2
And after that, they treated him for that problem.
[00:02:35.660] - Speaker 1
And before a snake bite, do you know how to prevent bites?
[00:02:43.020] - Speaker 2
No, not really. And would you trust the hospital in Carmen to treat a snake bite? It's hard to trust the hospital here.
[00:02:56.880] - Speaker 1
And why is that?
[00:02:59.210] - Speaker 2
Let's say, I don't know right now, but honestly, in my opinion, there's a lot of medical negligence. So, that's the problem. Because first of all, as happened to my sister-in-law, if they didn't pay attention to her in time, now, if they don't have an antidote, here at home, she'll be in trouble until they send her somewhere, God knows where. So, it's a very long time before that poison causes damage.
[00:03:29.260] - Speaker 1
Sure, yes. And if you need to go to the hospital, is that difficult? Yes, of course. Is it difficult for you or is it easy? With transportation and everything.
[00:03:40.810] - Speaker 2
It's difficult here, starting with the fact that transportation is difficult, because during the day, if you manage to get one in the morning here, the motorcycle taxis, or if you don't get one to call, you have to find one during the day, because at night it's like a big baby. The only thing is to ask around, maybe someone will do you a favor, because otherwise it's difficult, because transportation here isn't easy either.
[00:04:06.990] - Speaker 1
And where do you feel most likely to be bitten by a snake? Excuse me, in the countryside or at home?
[00:04:16.740] - Speaker 2
No, always in the countryside. Outside, you run a greater risk of being bitten, because in the house, it's usually very unlikely. I'm not saying they don't come in, but it's very rare for one to bite you in the house. So, outside, you're more likely to be bitten by one.
[00:04:36.490] - Speaker 1
And do you know how to identify poisonous snakes or non-poisonous snakes?
[00:04:42.730] - Speaker 2
Let's say, here, of the ones that commonly arrive here, because I know there are many, but let's say, for example, here is a knot shell. Here in the house, we've never seen one, or anywhere nearby, we've never seen one. Here, the size is what matters most. There are different types, because among the most common ones that arrive are the X, which they call talla chicalada, and the podridora. I remember they call the other one Panama. But that's it, because they only arrive here, I can't think of any others La Coral is also one that you always find. It's like this, I don't know, last time, there was definitely a small camera around and there were four or five little corales, but they were turning up around the yard. But here, the most common one is culera, but it doesn't affect anything, at least not the one we call cazadora, the little green one we call bejuca. But the one... What's the name of the little coffee plant that came out that day?
[00:06:00.346] - Speaker 2
I forgot.
[00:06:01.390] - Speaker 1
And how do you identify snakes? By their color, their skin, their head, or something else?
[00:06:07.050] - Speaker 2
Let's say that, apart from the color, the head is also different from that of the culebra brava, because the culebra brava always has a more triangular head.
[00:06:22.680] - Speaker 1
Do you know of any other cases of snake bites?
[00:06:30.730] - Speaker 2
Yes, around here, but no. I mean, not right here. Yes, Mrs. Luz Mela was the one who got it right here nearby. He also had a relative who died, this Marielena. Marielena Cabienes, from La Serra. He killed her too. That's what she died of, she was bitten by a snake. And yes, we've known several cases.
[00:06:53.660] - Speaker 1
Yes. And, well, I don't have any more questions, but do you have anything else to say about snakes or your knowledge? Anything else?
[00:07:02.930] - Speaker 2
No, ma'am, no.
[00:07:05.240] - Speaker 1
Well, and it's important to know after a snake bite, do you need to go straight to the hospital? Yes, of course. And it's important to see what kind of snake bit you, because there are different antivenoms for different snakes. Yes, ma'am. You can take a picture of the snake or you can kill it and take it to the hospital. And yes, tourniquets are not recommended because the blood needs to circulate in the body. And yes, that's the most important thing to know about snakes. But thank you very much for your time, you're very kind. You're welcome.
