[00:00:01.230] - Speaker 1
And what's your name? Diomedes. And how old are you?
[00:00:06.690] - Speaker 3
Thirty-eight.
[00:00:07.920] - Speaker 1
And what do you do for a living? If you work?
[00:00:09.900] - Speaker 3
Here in a physiotherapy center, here on a farm.
[00:00:12.570] - Speaker 1
Are you married or single?
[00:00:14.930] - Speaker 3
I came already, but he didn't leave married. Hey, free.
[00:00:17.860] - Speaker 1
Do you have children?
[00:00:19.360] - Speaker 3
No, ma'am.
[00:00:20.070] - Speaker 1
And how many years have you lived in El Carmen?
[00:00:23.120] - Speaker 3
What are they doing all their lives? He was born.
[00:00:26.430] - Speaker 1
Here. Here. Ma'am.
[00:00:27.850] - Speaker 2
Since he was born.
[00:00:28.930] - Speaker 1
So, do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:34.940] - Speaker 3
What do you mean?
[00:00:36.200] - Speaker 1
Do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:41.240] - Speaker 2
Should the snake bite itself, or should one of us bite it?
[00:00:44.780] - Speaker 1
And let him bite it. It's a possibility.
[00:00:47.850] - Speaker 3
That it might suddenly bite you. Yes. Not here, I can't. To be honest, I haven't come across any like that.
[00:00:55.200] - Speaker 2
I have found myself.
[00:00:57.470] - Speaker 1
Yes.
[00:00:58.820] - Speaker 2
And so, the attack of the brave ones. And I've killed them. But they've never, ever killed me. They've thrown me down, but that's because, unfortunately, you find them in thickets and suddenly they're attacking or something. You're exaggerating. So, the weak ones with the tail and one of them pulls. But that's bad, isn't it? And the most likely thing from the snake's bite is If they take it to the hospital quickly, and if not, you'll see, it died. And the snake stayed alive. So, you liked the snake better, but if it already bit you, you have to go to the hospital urgently, and if not, it will also die, and they'll bury it better among the snakes. Well, that's the remedy of remedies, so if a snake bites you, it's urgent to go to the hospital.
[00:02:10.500] - Speaker 1
That's all. Have any of your animals been bitten by a snake, a pet, or livestock?
[00:02:21.950] - Speaker 3
No. No? No?
[00:02:24.690] - Speaker 1
And do you know how to prevent a snake bite or avoid a snake bite? No, ma'am. And what would you do if a snake bit you?
[00:02:36.120] - Speaker 3
Well, what would you do?
[00:02:37.480] - Speaker 2
What if it dies? I'll tell you in this little story. The snake, or what?
[00:02:41.520] - Speaker 1
If you were bitten by a snake, what would you do?
[00:02:45.010] - Speaker 2
What if she dies? No, if the bitch bites him, what would you do then? That's when we told him what I'm telling him now. Yes. Rush him to the hospital, because there are no drugs for him there right now. She bit him, so run to the hospital.
[00:03:03.510] - Speaker 1
Which hospital would you go to?
[00:03:04.950] - Speaker 2
To the hospital here, Carmen.
[00:03:07.510] - Speaker 1
You too?
[00:03:08.400] - Speaker 2
Yes, because it's closer.
[00:03:11.370] - Speaker 1
And would you trust the hospital, in Carmen, to heal a bruise like that? No, I don't know.
[00:03:16.020] - Speaker 2
They arrive and immediately start
[00:03:18.250] - Speaker 3
There, they ask you for the spinal, turn two.
[00:03:21.180] - Speaker 2
According to
[00:03:22.190] - Speaker 3
The hospital over there is more powerful.
[00:03:24.330] - Speaker 2
They give him an injection to cut the poison a little. And if it's serious, they send him to the main hospital, and there they give him RAP. This is to prevent contagion, to prevent the poison from reaching someone else here and killing them.
[00:03:48.440] - Speaker 1
And if you need to go to the hospital, is that difficult for you or easy?
[00:03:58.620] - Speaker 3
I have a motorcycle there, but yes, if I'm alone, you can give me a ride so I can
[00:04:06.800] - Speaker 1
Is it difficult for you to go to the hospital?
[00:04:10.750] - Speaker 2
Yesterday, they submerged him even more. And me, God forbid. I'd rather be bitten by a snake. God forbid. What am I supposed to do? I live far away, or not very far, but by the time I get here to ask for help, and if the man says that the motorcycle is broken, it's the only way I can get to the hospital quickly. Otherwise, he'll die there, because I have no one to help me. They'll have to take me to a crossroads and find a friend to take me there, but right away. I understand, yes. So, when the poison kicks in, he'll move forward, forward, and when he gets there, that's it. Then, mix it. And like the poison, that, like the poison, that, when it gets into the blood, it reaches the heart and that's it.
[00:05:23.440] - Speaker 1
And where do you feel most likely to be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:05:32.440] - Speaker 3
Always in the paddocks, safer.
[00:05:34.450] - Speaker 2
In the pastures?
[00:05:35.260] - Speaker 1
Why?
[00:05:36.510] - Speaker 2
Because they keep a lot in the mountains.
[00:05:42.410] - Speaker 3
And they keep them in their ears, the cracks make a hole and they get in, they suck on them, and without knowing how to read, you go and make it easier for them.
[00:05:53.960] - Speaker 2
It's like there's a big hill, and they go there to cut it down with machetes, to clear the pasture. You have to be careful there because the snakes are venomous, they can bite you. I've killed several snakes, but thank God none of them bit me.
[00:06:17.510] - Speaker 1
Never. Yes, thank God. And do you know how to identify poisonous snakes or snakes that are venomous?
[00:06:24.890] - Speaker 3
Around here, is the carving the most poisonous? Is that the most poisonous one?
[00:06:30.290] - Speaker 2
Here, for example, there's very little rotten fruit. The most common is size X. That's the most The rest are small, here and there, but they see you and run away. They're half-rotten.
[00:06:46.730] - Speaker 3
The mitados. But this thing doesn't
[00:06:50.600] - Speaker 2
But the fiercest snake is size X.
[00:06:58.100] - Speaker 1
From "And how do you identify snakes? Is it by their color, their skin, their head?"
[00:07:05.570] - Speaker 3
Because of the color.
[00:07:06.800] - Speaker 2
The color. They have an X on top of them. They have an X like this. And they are gray in color. And I killed one that had a head like this, about the size of my hand, and it was 2.20 long.
[00:07:26.660] - Speaker 3
That thick. Is this where you killed that kid? He said, "So, it didn't sting me this time, I mean, it didn't bite me because where I kicked it last time, it would have killed me."
[00:07:39.750] - Speaker 2
I was dying to grow up, it kills me.
[00:07:45.220] - Speaker 1
And do you know of any cases of snake bites? No. No? And do you know of any cases of snake bites?
[00:07:56.790] - Speaker 2
Do I know him?
[00:07:58.180] - Speaker 1
Do you know of a case of a snake bite? Did someone get bitten by a snake?
[00:08:05.390] - Speaker 2
Well, nowadays, if someone gets bitten by a snake, they get medical attention quickly and are saved. But you wouldn't say, "Hey, did you hear that so-and-so was killed by a snake?" You haven't heard that. In this neighborhood, you haven't heard that. Yes, so-and-so was bitten by a snake. Well, they took him to the hospital and saved him. But the rest, that he was killed outright, no.
[00:08:40.240] - Speaker 1
Okay. Well, I don't have any more questions, but do you have anything else to say about snakes or your knowledge of snakes or anything else?
[00:08:50.960] - Speaker 3
No.
[00:08:52.620] - Speaker 1
Anything else to say about snakes?
[00:08:55.340] - Speaker 2
Your Honor, I hope they come and get rid of all the filth. They shouldn't scare us anymore.
[00:09:03.240] - Speaker 3
But it has everything.
[00:09:04.850] - Speaker 2
No, but anyway But anyway... I'm always here... Look, there are a lot of snakes on all these hills, snakes like that. They've come into my house, but they're like daughters of the X. But I have a cat that... And I kill those. Otherwise, yes, you have to be careful in the woods where you go to gather firewood and stuff. Be very careful because they're in the palm tree stumps, under the cusques or in some vine thickets. Of course, yes. And you have to be careful, you have to be very careful. And the rest, because they don't go away. They're not scared of noise. Noise makes them go lesbian. Ready. But the rest don't chase them. Nobody does.
[00:10:14.120] - Speaker 1
Well, it's important to know that after a snake bite, it's important to go straight to the hospital. To the hospital. And it's important to know what kind of snake bit you, because there are different antivenoms for different snakes. You can take a picture of the snake or you can kill it and take it to the hospital. And yes, that's the most important thing to know about snake bites. And well, that's all I have. Thank you very much for your time. No, don't die. And what's your name?
[00:10:51.910] - Speaker 2
Me. They're calling me on the phone. I'm sorry you died.
[00:10:59.350] - Speaker 1
What is your name?
[00:11:01.560] - Speaker 2
Alejandro Larcón.
[00:11:03.700] - Speaker 1
And how old are you?
[00:11:06.750] - Speaker 2
75. That's what I'm waiting for, that if a snake suddenly bites me, I'll be dead.
[00:11:14.490] - Speaker 1
And you agree to the interview and recording, yes? Yes or no? What? Do you agree to the interview and recording?
[00:11:26.430] - Speaker 2
That's right. It's correct that they're watching you.
[00:11:31.950] - Speaker 1
But I recorded the interview, and you answered. I want to know if you agree.
[00:11:43.420] - Speaker 2
I agree. I agree with the interview, because people need to know. Well, they should ask how the man died. It wasn't a nervous breakdown or anything like that; he was bitten by a snake. So, to make a comparison, God forbid that a snake kills me and I die in the interview, what would you do? I wonder.
[00:12:22.210] - Speaker 1
Me?
[00:12:23.640] - Speaker 2
Yes, I wonder what you would do, because you are interviewing us about love today. If I didn't even love my wife, and she bit me and I died, what would you do in that interview? No, you can bury me, right? Because what else? Because you would say: She bit him and he died.
[00:12:51.710] - Speaker 3
He's already dead.
[00:12:53.410] - Speaker 1
Yes. Okay, okay, that's it. I have two more questions. Are you married or single? Me?
[00:13:03.930] - Speaker 2
Yes. Both.
[00:13:05.950] - Speaker 1
Married and single. And you have children.
[00:13:11.340] - Speaker 2
Two.
[00:13:12.310] - Speaker 1
And how many years have you lived in El Carmen?
[00:13:15.260] - Speaker 2
Well, thank you very much, everyone.
[00:13:23.220] - Speaker 1
All done.
[00:13:24.230] - Speaker 2
Hey, your neighbor, wasn't she sent by President Trump?
