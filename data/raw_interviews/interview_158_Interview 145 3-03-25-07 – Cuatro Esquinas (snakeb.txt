Interview 145 3-03-25-07 – Cuatro Esquinas (snakebite victim)
[00:00:00.290] - Speaker 2
What's your name?
[00:00:01.640] - Speaker 1
My name is Luis David Leon.
[00:00:03.270] - Speaker 2
And how old are you?
[00:00:06.010] - Speaker 1
I am 36 years old.
[00:00:08.640] - Speaker 2
And what do you do for a living?
[00:00:09.870] - Speaker 1
As administrator of this property.
[00:00:12.210] - Speaker 2
Are you married or single?
[00:00:13.860] - Speaker 1
Common-law marriage.
[00:00:15.200] - Speaker 2
Do you have children?
[00:00:15.600] - Speaker 1
Yes, ma'am.
[00:00:17.960] - Speaker 2
How many years have you lived in Carmen?
[00:00:20.280] - Speaker 1
Thirty-six years ago.
[00:00:24.170] - Speaker 2
So, do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:28.550] - Speaker 1
Yes, because it has already bitten me.
[00:00:30.300] - Speaker 2
Really? Yes, ma'am. Poisonous or non-poisonous?
[00:00:34.180] - Speaker 1
I was bitten by one over there, when that thing started, on the other side, over there, the one with the stream. One bit me, but we didn't know for sure what kind of snake it was. But yes, it was poisonous, because I ended up in Tolemayda to get the antidote for all kinds of snakes. And then, about two months later, another one bit me there nearby.
[00:00:57.840] - Speaker 2
Another one? Yes.
[00:00:59.510] - Speaker 1
But then, here, or at least where I live, I don't know if the town also agrees, but we use bubble gel a lot. So we take that.
[00:01:11.890] - Speaker 2
Didn't you go to the hospital?
[00:01:13.550] - Speaker 1
No, I didn't go back for the second one. I took the 50 drops of bubble bile and that was it.
[00:01:20.270] - Speaker 2
And the first one, sorry, was that a size or what?
[00:01:25.790] - Speaker 1
Well, she said it was true, but we didn't know why because it was between a puddle and was full of leaves. So I stuck the pod in to get some water out and it bit me here. And yes, I ran from here to the gate and it bit me. When I woke up there, at the Carmen hospital, they sent me to Tolemayla. They kept me there for two days and then three guys took me here, and they kept me here at the hospital for three days and then they took me out.
[00:01:51.900] - Speaker 2
Did it hurt a lot?
[00:01:54.250] - Speaker 1
Yes, it's as if your body were on fire. It's as if you were burning all the time. And my hand turned black, like the color of the clock, completely black. I was scared because I thought it was a black widow spider, because black widow spiders first bite and then the area starts to rot. But no, thank God it wasn't that kind of spider.
[00:02:21.690] - Speaker 2
And did the death happen here, on this farm, or somewhere else?
[00:02:28.510] - Speaker 1
No, not on this property, but on the other side, on the other property line.
[00:02:30.750] - Speaker 2
In the afternoon, in the evening.
[00:02:33.300] - Speaker 1
In the morning, during the morning hours. That was during the morning hours. That caught fire over there, and I had to go pay for it. And the other one was here, here on the farm, in the pasture over there. But I found her on Mateo Street, but she was wearing a kind of jacket. But like they say, they pair up, they cross paths with the right size, size X, all that.
[00:02:58.560] - Speaker 2
But I took it.
[00:03:01.530] - Speaker 1
Yes, it made me dizzy and I felt sick all day and threw up and all that, but I took the one for that day.
[00:03:07.040] - Speaker 2
The first one?
[00:03:07.790] - Speaker 1
The second one. Because I went to bed there, I was alone. The woman was working, the boy brought her back at around six in the afternoon, and when they arrived, they found me. I had a fever and everything, but I didn't want to go. I took the 50 drops and that was it. And here I am, thank God, I'm immune now. Yes, sir.
[00:03:30.370] - Speaker 2
So, has any of your animals ever been bitten by a snake? A pet, livestock?
[00:03:37.260] - Speaker 1
The cattle, yes. That's what killed me here. About four years ago, I was killed by a piece of land here, although they said it was coal. No, it was a snake that killed him.
[00:03:49.440] - Speaker 2
And now, do you know how to prevent or avoid snake bites before they happen? Do you have any prevention methods?
[00:04:01.550] - Speaker 1
No, right now we don't have the methods here, because you still get dirty in the forest. The only prevention is that we wear rubber boots, because you always clean where you're going to be. Look at the place where you're going to go in, don't say anything, because the animals could be there and you could step on them three or four times, and the fifth time you go there, one of them will bite you. But no, it's not that you have or don't have the means to apply yourself at a given moment, no.
[00:04:28.280] - Speaker 2
Now, what would you do if another snake bites you?
[00:04:38.350] - Speaker 1
What would you do, Mom? Well, then I would definitely seek help, because I no longer have what I used to have, as I told you, the home remedies that we know, seek help or rush to the clinic right away, if you have time, because there are some types of snakes that don't give you much time, and there are others that can kill you in an instant, so then there's nothing you can do. And if you're in the mountains, alone, then you're screwed, because you're done for.
[00:05:03.910] - Speaker 2
And why, in your secondary case, why didn't you go to the hospital? How? For the second
[00:05:18.240] - Speaker 1
The bite? Yes. No, it wasn't because I didn't want to. It's just that, to be honest, I don't like hospitals. I don't like hospitals.
[00:05:26.420] - Speaker 2
And you didn't have much pain either, or did you?
[00:05:31.780] - Speaker 1
Yes, I had pain and, as I said, fever and vomiting.
[00:05:36.080] - Speaker 2
But you didn't go to the hospital.
[00:05:37.450] - Speaker 1
It wasn't The next day, I left and worked for a while, but I felt dizzy. So, I went home and sat around there. It was on the third day that I started to feel sick again, so I took those boots and that was it, it didn't happen again.
[00:05:54.890] - Speaker 2
And when she first started dying, did you go to the hospital in El Carmen? Yes, ma'am. And did they give you the anxiety medication in El Carmen or at another hospital?
[00:06:11.520] - Speaker 1
Elsewhere, in Tolemaida.
[00:06:12.910] - Speaker 2
In Tolemaida, okay. Yes, ma'am. And now, if a snake dies on you, would you go to the hospital in Carmen or would you not go?
[00:06:24.130] - Speaker 1
No, well, yes, it's about time. It already happened, but they didn't go there because it's dangerous. I don't have the things I need in case something like that happens. I don't have that medicine anymore because it's hard to find. It's a liquid, boruco gel, and you can hardly find it at the pharmacy because they regulate it because of that animal's house, so But yes, bubble gel is 100% reliable.
[00:06:52.590] - Speaker 2
And where do you feel you are most likely to be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:07:03.640] - Speaker 1
He's here in the countryside. You never know, he could be out working, since Dad doesn't go to work. That's more likely. But the most likely place is when I go to work, over there where they have the job he has to do, yes, most likely, over there in that direction.
[00:07:19.110] - Speaker 2
And do you know how to tell if it's a poisonous snake or not?
[00:07:24.980] - Speaker 1
Well, here the only poisonous snake is the talla, the talla X, the rattlesnake, which is the one I know Yes, because there's the ova, there's the cazadora. But they're animals that if you don't bother them, I walk around with a stick, to see if she follows you.
[00:07:52.770] - Speaker 2
And how do you identify snakes? By their color, by their skin?
[00:07:56.990] - Speaker 1
Because of the color, because here we catalyze the size, and the size, it has some little things, like spots, stripes. And the raboja, which is the other one that is also poisonous because it stings on both sides. On the tail and on the face. It bites and stings with its tail. That one is known by its color, because it is red and white. Red and black with white stripes, white stripes. And the head is black and the tail is black, and that's how it is. And the size, that one is known by its sheath, which has some gray stripes, some brownish spots. And size X, that one is known because it has a cross like this. We know that one is size X. The rotten one, we know it's like an ashy color, an ashy color, and it's all wet now.
[00:08:42.950] - Speaker 2
So, there you have it. Do you know of any other cases of snake help?
[00:08:50.240] - Speaker 1
Not here, not all the time. Just sometimes. I have an uncle who was also bitten by one. He was bitten while working in the fields and, thank God, he survived, but it was really bad because he had had that thing for quite a while. And what about others? My wife was also bitten, she was bitten too.
[00:09:17.110] - Speaker 2
Really? Yes, it didn't sting my wife. Is it poisonous or something?
[00:09:20.950] - Speaker 1
One of those babies bit her, but it seemed like there was something else going on. They say all snakes have venom, but some are more potent than others. But my wife, she had it in the hospital, so they gave her that antivenom they made. That stuff, and they gave it to her. They kept her there for two days and then let her out, because she, my mother, started to swell up.
[00:09:44.020] - Speaker 2
And she went to the hospital in Carmen? Yes, of course, I took my son there. Okay. That's too bad. You two were bitten by a snake.
[00:09:57.490] - Speaker 1
That's too bad. No, that's just something people say: "Oops! Those animals, I'm terrified of them, I can't look because I freeze up and stand there like a statue. Yes, I don't know, I'm terrified of those creatures. But when I see one there, I go and kill it or catch it and throw it away, and then we go somewhere else. But yes, I've heard of several cases, of course. Not here in the village, no, in the town, no. It's not just in the village that there are snakes, there are snakes everywhere, in several places. Yes, lots of them. And here, thank God, I don't think there are any anymore.
[00:10:35.070] - Speaker 2
Well, I don't have any more questions, but do you have anything else to say about snakes, your knowledge of snakes, or should I ask you more questions about snakes?
[00:10:47.250] - Speaker 1
Well, as for snakes, here we mostly find the ones that are around, the ones that come into the yard of the house, which are called guíos. But that kind of guío also mates with the talla. That one is also dangerous, because it squeezes, bites, and has venom. There's another one called What is it called? The coral. The coral snake is also poisonous. Very poisonous. Yes, the coral snake. That's the only one, because as far as I know, I don't know any others, because there are several, many kinds. But here, mostly, we know those, or at least those that I know. I don't know if other people know more animals like those. And it's an animal that I think is a cuino. That's something that shouldn't exist in the world. But anyway... And that research you're doing on the snake, what's that for?
[00:11:56.890] - Speaker 2
It's to understand more about the people here, because ultimately I want to reduce the number of snake bites and encounters. And now I need to understand more about the situation of the people here and their experiences with snake bites and encounters. But my colleagues at the University of Los Andes are experts in snakes. I am an expert in public health; I study public health and medicine, not snakes. But anyway, one more question: did your wife receive treatment for physical anxiety at the Carmen hospital?
[00:12:51.680] - Speaker 1
Yes, in Carmen, yes, because we caught the snake. And so we were able to sacrifice it and take it to find out what physical treatment it needs, because they use several different ones If it's more poisonous, they have to use a stronger one.
[00:13:04.360] - Speaker 2
And she didn't know which snake bit you?
[00:13:08.110] - Speaker 1
No, because I didn't know anything, but I was the one She told me, "It bit me there, and it was all curled up." But that was back in the village where she worked.
[00:13:15.490] - Speaker 2
How long ago?
[00:13:16.850] - Speaker 1
That makes it I've been here for six years, it's been about eight or nine years now.
[00:13:23.640] - Speaker 2
And how many years ago did your cases happen?
[00:13:26.520] - Speaker 1
The other case was like in 2025, it was like in 2023. Okay. Did you go to that meeting? Both cases at the same time, the same year.
[00:13:39.140] - Speaker 2
That's too bad. Yes. And well, it's important to know, but you know, it's important to have the right to go to the hospital after a snake bite, and it's important to know what kind of snake killed you. You can take a picture of the snake, you can kill it and take it to the hospital. But I think you already know what to do. Yes, ma'am. But anyway, thank you very much for your time.
[00:14:08.070] - Speaker 1
No, don't worry. Right here.
[00:14:11.220] - Speaker 2
Yes, thank you.
[00:14:12.030] - Speaker 1
We will gladly assist in any way we can.
[00:14:14.400] - Speaker 2
Yes, thank you.
