[00:00:29.990] - Speaker 1
I'm an interior decorator. And here I am, practically managing this house that belongs to my brother. Yes, it's under construction.
[00:00:42.790] - Speaker 2
And those houses, are they separate or single?
[00:00:46.410] - Speaker 1
I'm separated.
[00:00:48.310] - Speaker 2
Do you have children?
[00:00:49.680] - Speaker 1
Yes, I have three children, all grown up now.
[00:00:53.470] - Speaker 2
And how many years have you lived here in El Carmen?
[00:00:57.410] - Speaker 1
Well, I'm here to stay for months. According to the construction contract here, I'm here to check things out. And since my family, my brothers, my mother, and all of us are there, my mother comes frequently, I accompany her, my brother-in-law and my sister live here, they're fine. So, I'll stay here for six, seven months, eight months, a year. Then I'll go back to Bogotá, back here, wherever I need to be.
[00:01:36.920] - Speaker 2
So, do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here?
[00:01:40.950] - Speaker 1
In fact, I've already encountered several. I've had to face them. They were small, thankfully. I'm very afraid of them, but I've been told how to tell them apart, more or less, although when I've come across them, I don't look at them, I'm too scared, because you're always terrified of snakes, whatever kind they are. So, I've had several encounters at my mother's house, on the road, here on the farm, and on the other farm. Snakes of all kinds are also quite common in this area.
[00:02:39.700] - Speaker 2
Can you identify snakes?
[00:02:42.070] - Speaker 1
Not really, but I've been told that the most common one is passive, the one that's guío, guío, the big one, which eats animals like a boa constrictor. That's because we actually had one here once. It ate two kittens, even. And then there are the small ones I've seen, about 50 centimeters, a meter long but thin. I've seen the size X one, I've seen the one that's red and black. I don't know if that's the size X. No, that's another one, right? Coral, I think they call it. Colal, yes, a colal. Small, not so big. I've also come across them on the road, and they always give me a fright. In fact, as I almost always go out in the evenings, at dusk, I don't recognize them well, but I do see them moving and jumping.
[00:03:50.830] - Speaker 2
And have any of your animals been bitten by a snake, such as a pet or livestock or something like that?
[00:04:00.040] - Speaker 1
I think the chickens have been bitten and killed, because they show up there dead. Albertico tells me that's what happens, that sometimes one of those little snakes bites them. They get in everywhere. I've been bitten by one of those scorpions. The other day, a scorpion bit me, and I thought it was a But Albertico told me, "No, it's not a snake bite, it's a scorpion on your finger." It's always a little painful too. Yes. Yes, it's terrifying, if you see one, you're afraid it's going to bite you without you knowing, because you can't really identify them well. I'm not from around here, I was born here, but I come here sporadically, every few months. And we've been buying land and everything here for over 20 years, but we come occasionally, for construction work or vacations. But it's good to know how to identify them so you know what to do. Then, if you come across someone who... Or you guys who know about these things, you can tell them what to do in a situation like that.
[00:05:17.670] - Speaker 2
And do you know how to prevent or avoid a snake bite before it happens?
[00:05:24.070] - Speaker 1
No, not at all. What I know to avoid is running.
[00:05:28.150] - Speaker 2
Yes, of course. And what would you do if a snake died?
[00:05:33.860] - Speaker 1
I faced it, yes, I was facing it like it was about 80 centimeters tall, something like that, but I killed it because it scared me, and I killed it with a shovel, something like that, I had it in my hand that day. I did it because she seemed dangerous to me, because she was curling up and pulling at me. And I was trimming some bushes, and it just happened, she didn't bite my hand, it was fine, my God. But yes, it always scares you and you don't know what to do. The shock made me react and kill her like that, but it wasn't because I was brave, it was because I was scared.
[00:06:13.530] - Speaker 2
And if you had a snake bite, would you go to the hospital or?
[00:06:21.090] - Speaker 1
Of course, it's only logical to seek immediate medical attention, because what can you do if you don't know anything? Or at least I don't know what happened, we don't have, we don't know what to do in a situation like that. There have been people here who have been bitten and haven't gone to the doctor quickly. Or another person I noticed down there in Bien Abajo, on the broadcast, I don't see him anymore, who was bitten by a snake and died. The guy died in bed. He got sick right there on the floor. And the precaution I always take is to check when I go to the bathroom, to see if there's one coiled up around there or if I see one anywhere.
[00:07:12.050] - Speaker 2
And if you need to go, is it difficult or easy for you to get to the hospital?
[00:07:17.400] - Speaker 1
Yes, of course. The same here, depending on the time. I have a motorcycle here, but I don't know how to ride it and I don't dare. I don't have a car because I didn't bring it here; they get damaged a lot. But I would probably ask my brother-in-law, who is the closest, and Vertigo, who is my neighbor, for help. They are the closest people I have. May God help me, protect me, my God. I'm terrified of it.
[00:07:47.300] - Speaker 2
Would you go to the hospital, to Carmen, or to the other hospital?
[00:07:51.460] - Speaker 1
Carmen, because that's closer. Anyway, if he's being operated on with good equipment now, the mayor said on Saturday that they came to give us that information, that they were bringing good things to the hospital and that it was good to have good care so that people wouldn't have to go elsewhere. The same citizens here, from the village and the town. So it's good for us too.
[00:08:20.790] - Speaker 2
And where do you feel most likely to be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:08:27.640] - Speaker 1
No, in the fields, yes, obviously.
[00:08:30.660] - Speaker 2
Why?
[00:08:31.810] - Speaker 1
Because it's more exposed, animals come from all over. These are open fields. Here we have prevention measures in place Excuse me a moment. And coffee. We have prevention measures in place, we keep an eye out and quickly throw away those poisons that they say you have to buy, but they're no longer in your orders, they've been taken away. Because you feel bad killing animals anyway, because they're species that are here for a reason too. You're aware of that, and I'm one of those people who feels really bad about killing an animal, because you think, "Well, God sent them here for a purpose, with a mission, they have something to do." And apart from the fear you have of them and all that, every animal must have its job to do. But in a case like that, if it's a dangerous snake, well, obviously, you feel helpless in the face of that too. And even more so as a woman. A man might react more than you would.
[00:09:52.694] - Speaker 1
Or if they already know what to do, well... But I, at least, don't really know. And I know I go out running.
[00:10:02.350] - Speaker 2
Sure. And do you know of any cases of snake bites?
[00:10:08.420] - Speaker 1
Well, for now, I've only heard that the man who died about 10 or 8 years ago died over there in Misiones. I don't know if you enjoy it. Yes. Someone, an older man. The lady who sells, I think it's curd or something like that. Well, look, I think she also applied a snake in her kitchen, right? She was really sick. But we haven't talked about it or anything, because she's also very close to us. Things happen very quickly around here.
[00:10:49.150] - Speaker 2
Well, I don't have any more questions, but do you have anything else to say about snakes or your knowledge of snakes?
[00:10:56.100] - Speaker 1
I would like you to come here to this neighborhood, just as you have taken the trouble to come and ask for information, and also to come and give it. The knowledge you have would be very useful for the people here to know what to do in such situations. I can lend you my house for the meeting whenever you want, with pleasure. Just let me know the time and anything else, and give me plenty of notice. I'll give you my number so you can keep in touch. That would be great.
[00:11:31.000] - Speaker 2
Yes, I agree, yes.
[00:11:33.830] - Speaker 1
Because it's important. It's extremely important. There are children here too, and older people, and anyone else. People who come to visit us too. So, yes, it's also dangerous if one of those animals gets out, if you don't know what to do in that moment, how to block the poison, how to do it, all of that is important.
[00:11:59.280] - Speaker 2
Yes, of course.
[00:12:01.060] - Speaker 1
I agree very much. It's also good to know the colors of these animals. My brother-in-law has a little knowledge, which he learned many years ago, that some are for one thing and others shouldn't be killed, that you have to catch them and get rid of them, whatever it takes. But for now, one's first reaction to a snake, whatever it is, is to kill it, because the fright it gives you is tremendous. I say this from my own experience, as I've had to deal with them myself. So, I got rid of the snakes from Bogotá that I found here in Anima.
[00:12:45.900] - Speaker 2
Yes, of course. Yes, no, it's important, I agree. My colleagues come sometimes, they do more education, because they are experts on snakes. I study public health, I know more about how to prevent snake bites. But it's important to know that after a snake bite, it's important to go straight to the hospital and it's important to know what kind of snake bit you, because there are different antivenoms for different snakes.
[00:13:24.720] - Speaker 1
That's the problem, because at night, who's going to see it?
[00:13:29.410] - Speaker 2
Yes.
[00:13:30.110] - Speaker 1
Exactly. The day I got stung by a scorpion on that little tree, I was lifting things and rocks and everything, and I went and stuck my hand in there, and it stung me, and I said, "A julebra," because I felt a sharp sting. But no, thank God it wasn't, but I didn't even realize it. Alberto, who knows about stings, more or less, told me, "No, it's not a snake, it's a scorpion." And he put a tourniquet on me and everything so I wouldn't go into shock, which is also really bad. Thank God I didn't go into shock too badly. Explain all that to her.
[00:14:07.010] - Speaker 2
After a snake bite, you can take a photo of the snake or you can kill it and take it to the hospital. It is important to have a flashlight or your phone and you can use the light, but it is important to kill poisonous snakes if they bite you, because it is important
[00:14:38.360] - Speaker 1
Know which one, so you know what antidote they give you. Yes, exactly. But there's a problem.
[00:14:43.960] - Speaker 2
Exactly, no, that's the problem.
[00:14:45.010] - Speaker 1
Sometimes you don't know, you're caught off guard. For example, it bites you, you go over there and it bites you, and who knows what time it is and everything. Yes, I have to protect myself by wearing boots. Yes. I've been there and I forget. And yes, I do that funny thing of always going in there, yes. But yes, yes, you have to do it. Because they run away quickly. They bite and then they're done. Yes, that's right. So that's the problem, that if, God forbid, it happens to someone, sometimes you can't do anything. No, she bites and then she's ready to bite again. And she stays ready to bite again. Well, that's important to know.
[00:15:31.460] - Speaker 2
Yes, and snakes like trash too, so it's important to clean the house.
[00:15:39.150] - Speaker 1
No, but here you have to keep cleaning.
[00:15:40.950] - Speaker 2
They can hide in the
[00:15:43.200] - Speaker 1
On the rocks and everything, in the bushes, a lot. People tell me that the bushes attract them a lot, yes
[00:15:51.130] - Speaker 2
Yes, and many people also believe that tourniquets are good after a snake bite, but they are not recommended because blood needs to circulate in the body. It is not advisable to use a tourniquet after a snake bite. You can ask for an arm or a leg. Yes, that's important to know.
[00:16:23.500] - Speaker 1
So what do we do now?
[00:16:25.820] - Speaker 2
Go straight to the hospital, because you need to get the anti-physiological medication very quickly, and you may have to wait a long time at the hospital. It is important to go straight there because you have about 12 hours to get it.
[00:16:53.760] - Speaker 1
Because they say that if you get bitten by a very poisonous snake or something like that, the poison spreads quickly and causes a heart attack. But that's after 12 hours, I think. After 12 hours, all of them? Yes, all of them.
[00:17:15.670] - Speaker 2
Yes. And I'm no snake expert, but vipers, like rattlesnakes and coral snakes, have different symptoms. Yes, and coral snakes can cause paralysis, and rattlesnakes can cause hemorrhage, emorage? Emorage. Emorado.
[00:17:47.160] - Speaker 1
Yes.
[00:17:48.420] - Speaker 2
And then the symptoms
[00:17:52.990] - Speaker 1
The symptoms are different.
[00:17:54.320] - Speaker 2
They are different, yes. But yes, you have about 12 hours. But it's important, and it's your right to go to the hospital. Of course, most of them. It's the priority. It's the most important thing, yes. But yes, yes. I don't have any more. Thank you very much. You too.
[00:18:17.530] - Speaker 1
Well, good luck with everything, and apart from that, we're at your service. If you need anything, you can also contact your colleagues and everyone else. And if you need help with a meeting room here, there is one available, and you can ask for it.
[00:18:35.970] - Speaker 2
Thank you, very kind. Yes, thank you.
[00:18:38.610] - Speaker 1
Well, I'm going to get you some coffee.
[00:18:40.920] - Speaker 2
Thank you.
