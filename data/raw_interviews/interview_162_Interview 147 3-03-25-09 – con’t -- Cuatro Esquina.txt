And it's not just because of five rare occasions that have happened, because many years ago I did hear someone say: Someone gave me the medicine here on the side of the ombri, like here, that side, they left it there, they gave him medicine and I don't know what else, but it stuck to him, it made a belt around him and he died. They have to kill that madman. Look, and I came here to be cured. They gave me about 300 cipro vir, so I took it for that. It poisoned my liver quite a bit. But I took it because the pain, my dear, is terrible, the pain is terrible. It affected my optic nerve, for sure. And in fact, they operated on me The doctor also tells me that it wasn't a consequence of... But I told him, "Doctor, what you gave me affected my eye, because I ended up with a broken macula." He told me it was the rays from this, but it broke both my eyes, both maculas.
[00:01:05.312] - Speaker 1
No, no, no, and that seemed strange to me, because I ended up... Because the pain I felt when I had that condition was so intense that I would never wish it on anyone else.
[00:01:18.620] - Speaker 1
It was an intense pain, so intense that I flinched with every twinge and said, "My God, what is this, Lord?" And it still hurts, even now, despite the surgery and everything. I'm still sensitive and it hurts inside, like the bone, right here. Sometimes I get that painful sensation. But the doctors told me that wasn't from them, but I think it was. Why is it so strange that after a year, I ended up with a broken macula in my eye? Anyway, I couldn't see your head, I couldn't see long distances, I couldn't see from here to there. So, I had an operation and I was still seeing blurry. Then they told me I should be at 80%, but my vision has deteriorated quite a bit since I had the operation. And sometimes I get pain, and if I take something for it, my sugar levels drop, and then it's worse. But it's terrible, because these things are so strange. I mean, that shingles thing seems very And it's repetitive.
[00:02:29.790] - Speaker 1
So, they tell me that it's also a variant of chickenpox or smallpox, something you give to children, and the virus stays dormant in your blood.
[00:02:41.040] - Speaker 1
And if someone who's older repeats it to you, it's a bit deadly, and if not, you get shingles anywhere on your body. It gave a friend of mine a rash on her butt, and she, poor thing, repeated it to me, but they gave her all that medicine and everything, and for the pain, because they give you really strong pain medicine, because the pain, especially in my eye, was incredible. It felt like it was going to explode inside me. I felt like that child was swelling up inside me, and it kind of settled in here, where my ear is. My ear swelled up, all of it. It was incredible. I'm still a little scared because it was horrible. And then, with those pills, I had a little bit of that in my hand, but they told me that it would take at least three to six months with that, and I said, "No, imagine that." That was also when my dad died. That was when he passed away too.
[00:03:41.453] - Speaker 1
I got out of that, my dad died, and I didn't go to visit because supposedly this is contagious.
[00:03:48.150] - Speaker 1
And yes, look how it sticks, just so you know. Shingles, as a variant of chickenpox, one of the two. So, it stays in the blood there. It comes back in the form of shingles, or chickenpox itself can be contracted by older people. And then it's more deadly. Since I got it, I researched everything I like to research, the bulb, the book, I like to research. And it turns out that there was a woman I told you about who gave her a slap on the butt and said, "Betty, I've had that twice already. And now it doesn't even work, and the medicine they gave me doesn't work either, I'm better off without it because it doesn't do anything anymore, the pain is unbearable and your skin gets too thin, son. So she went to someone who told her about a village in Villa de la Iba, and she went there and an old lady told her: Make yourself some juice from suelda con suelda. You know, suelda con suelda grows everywhere, in the river there's a place, the dwelling with green and total green, which is a little ribbon, it looks like a little ribbon, do you know it?
[00:05:04.720] - Speaker 1
Yes, the consulta. It's like a little skirt that she wears around her neck, and sometimes when they put it on as a decoration, she plays with it and it looks pretty. There's a lot of it in the river. Here. It grows near the rivers, so it's planted like a weed. But the one that works best is José's. And the ayuna is used for bleeding, nosebleeds, kidney bleeding, and all that. And the suelda con suelda, the greenest one, which is underneath and on top, is very green, that's the one used for a pure grilla. The lady gave me the remedy, crush it well, half crushed, take it on an empty stomach for about 15 days. The first five days, that is, the pain should already be gone. And the extra eight days or five days is to kill the virus. Well, look, it worked for me. It was the only thing that worked. It cleared up the infection, took away that terrible pain, and healed me, because I said, 'That healed me, that killed it.
[00:06:18.780] - Speaker 1
The lady herself sent me some boxes so it would stay cold, but I told her, 'No, keep it there on the farm, and she would tell me in Bogotá and everything.
[00:06:31.190] - Speaker 1
But anyway, she sent it to me, she wanted to send it to me. And I did it, and my daughter-in-law did it for me, because my daughter-in-law is like her, I get along very well with her. But she did all that for me in the morning, she would come over in the morning and I would be all painted up. Super good, super good. Interesting, yes. It's called Suella con suelda, as if they were growing on you. Which is so terrible, because that's something that's very I mean, the pain is very extreme.
