And what's your name? Clara Esildeal.
[00:00:13.880] - Speaker 1
And do you agree to the recording and interview?
[00:00:18.720] - Speaker 2
Well, if you say it's part of your job, the study you're doing, then let's see what constitutes an emergency, what can be thrown away? What can we drink? Or take something.
[00:00:35.130] - Speaker 1
Yes, I have questions, then I can say. And how old are you? 61. And what do you do? If you work. At home. And are you married, single?
[00:00:52.880] - Speaker 2
I've been alive for eight years.
[00:00:55.660] - Speaker 1
And how many years have you lived here?
[00:00:58.670] - Speaker 2
Well, here, as they say, because my father and mother lived here, but when you get married, you leave and then come back. Since they have passed away, my mother passed away a month and five days ago. So, when I am here, I have been with her for about five years, since my father passed away. He passed away here.
[00:01:19.880] - Speaker 1
So, do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here? Do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here? Well, of course, it's the countryside and there are lots of animals. Yes, okay.
[00:01:37.840] - Speaker 2
One is poisonous, the other isn't.
[00:01:39.890] - Speaker 1
Yes, of course.
[00:01:41.460] - Speaker 2
But if you have to deal with it, it's like having your eyes open.
[00:01:46.860] - Speaker 1
Yes.
[00:01:48.280] - Speaker 2
And those that migrate, which way do they go? And now that it's winter, they're looking to come back here. Cheers.
[00:01:54.790] - Speaker 1
Yes. And yes, has any of your animals ever been bitten by a snake, such as a pet or livestock?
[00:02:06.450] - Speaker 2
Blessed. Well, yes, sometimes you hear about it, but no, around here, not much. Not much. Although the cat or the monkey is the one who got her into trouble. And what she threw at him was vinegar, and she also confronts him. But around here, we're blessed, he already said, "And do you know how to prevent or avoid a snake bite?" No, I've heard that.
[00:02:39.610] - Speaker 1
And what would you do if a snake died?
[00:02:44.870] - Speaker 2
What I have heard is that Arceci had a cut with a cross, and that she is going to wash it with lots of soap and water. That is what I have heard. Others say that they took drops of red onion. Just worry about it, but not about red onion at the moment. I have not heard anything about that.
[00:03:12.190] - Speaker 1
Would you go to the hospital or the doctor as well?
[00:03:16.160] - Speaker 2
It's urgent, you told me.
[00:03:19.480] - Speaker 1
Would you go to the hospital? In Carmen or in?
[00:03:22.980] - Speaker 2
Here I would go there, because they're going to Cundá, and no, those little towns are death traps. Carmen is also leaving to go to No, to Espinal, to the best place. I have to look in the center.
[00:03:37.770] - Speaker 1
Wouldn't you trust the hospital, the Cunday, to cure a bite like this at the end of the month? Honestly, no.
[00:03:45.170] - Speaker 2
They say you need to have a shot for that, and I don't know if they have it at the little hospital, to be honest.
[00:03:53.940] - Speaker 1
Yes, before that. And if you need to go to the hospital, is that difficult for you or is it easy? If you need to go to the hospital.
[00:04:05.880] - Speaker 2
Well, thank God, no.
[00:04:08.960] - Speaker 1
It's easy. Where do you feel more likely to be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:04:22.960] - Speaker 2
Well, the truth is that when you live, let's say, here as we do, anywhere, because those animals come into the house, you go out and you don't wear boots or anything and they don't see you. So you're exposed to those animals.
[00:04:42.350] - Speaker 1
Do you know how to identify poisonous or venomous snakes?
[00:04:48.580] - Speaker 2
Not all of them.
[00:04:50.320] - Speaker 1
How do you identify different snakes? By their color?
[00:04:54.620] - Speaker 2
Because of The color, the size, the soybeans, the intricate work. Yes, it's very classy and also very traditional.
[00:05:05.370] - Speaker 1
And do you know of a case of snake bruising?
[00:05:12.070] - Speaker 2
No. Around here, on this street, thank God, no.
[00:05:17.090] - Speaker 1
I have no further questions, but do you have anything else to say about snakes or your knowledge of snakes, or anything else?
[00:05:32.470] - Speaker 2
No, because the truth is that around here, you don't hear anything. Yes, most of what I hear from my neighbors is that there is one, but we killed it. You can't leave them alive, that's why I'm telling you, whether they're poisonous or not, you have to kill them. And a lot of people say, "Don't kill them, they don't do anything."
[00:05:54.940] - Speaker 1
You kill them all.
[00:05:59.260] - Speaker 2
Yes.
[00:06:00.100] - Speaker 1
Well, the most important information comes after a snake bite.
[00:06:10.900] - Speaker 2
This one? No.
[00:06:13.550] - Speaker 1
It is important and your right to go to the nearest hospital. And it is important to know what kind of snake bit you, because there are different antidotes for different snakes. You can take a picture of the snake, kill it, and take it to the hospital as well.
[00:06:32.060] - Speaker 2
I've heard that too.
[00:06:34.380] - Speaker 1
And for snake bites, for prevention, it's important to clean the house, because snakes like trash and like to hide in trash. And you can use cryoline or other Ah, cryoline. Cryoline, yes. And it's important to wear boots in the countryside, big boots. And look carefully, that's important. At night, bring a flashlight.
[00:07:18.580] - Speaker 2
Yes, I go out there sometimes to the door, to get clothes, but I don't like my flashlight. The flashlight was important. Yes, because sometimes when they see it, they come inside.
[00:07:34.290] - Speaker 1
So Yes, it could be. And after a snake bite, tourniquets are also not recommended, because the blood needs to circulate. And if you apply a tourniquet, you could lose a leg or an arm.
[00:07:58.180] - Speaker 2
Yes, I turn it on a lot and it Yes, it's important to know. That's why you have to be careful. Yes.
[00:08:05.030] - Speaker 1
And yes, yes. That's the most important thing to know about snake bites. But thank you, I don't have any more questions. Thank you very much for your time. No, you're welcome.
[00:08:21.080] - Speaker 2
Thanks. Well, sometimes you don't pay attention to that. And in the countryside there's a lot of it, so you put a lot on
[00:08:30.780] - Speaker 1
Yes, exactly, exactly. Okay, yes.
