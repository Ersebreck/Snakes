[00:00:09.650] - Speaker 1

[00:00:25.200] - Speaker 2
And how many years have you lived here?
[00:00:28.070] - Speaker 1
We're about to complete 15 years here. Fifteen years.
[00:00:33.270] - Speaker 2
So, do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:37.720] - Speaker 1
Yes, it's likely because we're in their habitat. We're the invaders. And they were always here, but
[00:00:48.240] - Speaker 2
Sure.
[00:00:49.170] - Speaker 1
For thousands of years.
[00:00:50.260] - Speaker 2
Yes, of course.
[00:00:51.700] - Speaker 1
It's true. Once I found myself underneath the Underneath what? Underneath the seat of my motorcycle. I ride a motorcycle. That's where I found one of these. I'm going to be sleepy all day today. What kind of snake? A yellow one with a little tail.
[00:01:11.710] - Speaker 2
And have any of your animals been bitten by a snake, such as a pet?
[00:01:17.610] - Speaker 1
Look how she left the blind woman. That bitch went blind because a snake bit her. She's blind.
[00:01:26.110] - Speaker 2
From a poisonous one?
[00:01:27.020] - Speaker 1
I don't know what it would be. But that's how it turned out. Look how the poison made her eyes bulge out. She was completely blind, but she survived. What else?
[00:01:45.060] - Speaker 2
And do you know how to prevent or avoid a snake bite before you get bitten?
[00:01:50.980] - Speaker 1
The best thing was, as you say, prevention. Yes. Yes, see it and quickly move away or scare it off. Or pick it up or kill it. And there's also a home remedy. Look, I've got it here.
[00:02:09.220] - Speaker 2
There's nothing left, it's all broken up.
[00:02:17.060] - Speaker 1
What is it? A farmer gave this to me too. It's called borugo honey. And he was Yes. Borugo honey. Yes. You drink it...
[00:02:29.550] - Speaker 2
And And him.
[00:02:32.500] - Speaker 1
And him. It's like they're ripping it out of his liver. Yes.
[00:02:36.660] - Speaker 2
And what would you do if a snake bit you?
[00:02:39.140] - Speaker 1
I don't know what I would do. I would go to the first center. Yes. The first medical center you come across.
[00:02:47.540] - Speaker 2
Would you go to Kundai or Carmen?
[00:02:50.260] - Speaker 1
Kundai. We're halfway between the two towns. I think it's better to go to Carmen. The hospital there is better equipped.
[00:03:00.300] - Speaker 2
Would you go to the hospital in El Carmen to treat a snake bite? Yes, that's right.
[00:03:05.420] - Speaker 1
Because it's safer and faster. Because it's a matter of minutes.
[00:03:11.760] - Speaker 2
And if you need to go to the hospital, is it easy for you or is it easy? If you need to go to the hospital. No, well.
[00:03:18.550] - Speaker 1
Because if it incapacitates me, I ride my motorcycle. And if I'm here, you would have told me it's impossible to ride, I couldn't. But then there are neighbors, so I can call a neighbor.
[00:03:34.100] - Speaker 2
The neighbor over there with the car would be about 20 and a half minutes away. And where do you feel more likely to encounter a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:03:48.160] - Speaker 1
No, in the countryside.
[00:03:49.270] - Speaker 2
Why?
[00:03:50.290] - Speaker 1
Because at home, we prevent them from getting close by fumigating around with certain products that can open them up, which are smelly, such as Lorban, all those chemicals that are also used for agrochemicals. So, there's also ACPM and other things that are mixed together and sprayed around to prevent that. But at that time I didn't have any, but I have had, as I said, contact with them. Suddenly, my cat is very playful. And a few days ago he got the cat out and killed it back there. But just like that, a little bite.
[00:04:44.210] - Speaker 2
And do you know how to identify poisonous snakes or snakes that are venomous?
[00:04:50.200] - Speaker 1
No, I don't know about that.
[00:04:52.370] - Speaker 2
Okay. And do you know of a case of a snake bite? Yes. What happened?
[00:04:57.970] - Speaker 1
A neighbor whom I don't know, if you have the opportunity to talk to her, she lives there on a small farm up ahead. So, do you know her, this lady, Don Modesto's daughter? Do you know her around here? Not very well. She's the one who's involved in the community council. In front of the school. Her name is Emma. And did she go to respond? She had the experience, yes. I think, according to what they say, I don't know what she was doing, she has a little orange tree and she went out to look at the oranges, maybe to pick some, and she didn't notice that there was a snake in the grass and she almost stepped on it, so the little animal felt threatened and bit her. And she was in the hospital for a few days I don't know, actually, it would be good if you had the chance to go and hear about the experience from her. It's close by. Okay, yes. Does she live by the road?
[00:06:18.514] - Speaker 1
Yes. Shall we go there, just after the entrance? Okay.
[00:06:24.900] - Speaker 2
So, would you use the bubble one if you got bitten by a snake?
[00:06:29.730] - Speaker 1
It would be egg. It would be like I think it would be contaminated and spoiled. It's no good anymore. It's no good anymore, it's contaminated and spoiled. That's no good anymore. It's no good there, it's fine, it's coagulated. That's no good anymore. I put some bug in it. Yes.
[00:06:53.220] - Speaker 2
I have no further questions, but do you have anything else to say about snakes, your knowledge, anything else?
[00:07:01.860] - Speaker 1
No more. Like I said, the experience I had with that little bug on the motorcycle, after it rained, I covered the motorcycle, and it got in there and fell asleep. Luckily, that day I decided to uncover it, I don't know what I was going to look at, I was going to press something, I was going to take out a tool when I saw it there. Where I would have gone with it, it would have suddenly woken up from the shock and I would have been driving, because it was under the seat, and it would have bitten me. But that's all.
[00:07:38.880] - Speaker 2
And is it important to know after a snake bite whether it is important to go straight to the hospital? Yes, of course. And is it important to know what kind of snake bit you? Because there are different antivenoms.
[00:07:53.320] - Speaker 1
Around here, the most common ones are, as I said, size X, the tal. There are some that say they aren't The bejuca, which is called a tal bejuca, but that's not... The guío, the guío isn't like a... Boa, yes. An oa. And the coral, the red and white one. And there's a fake coral too. Yes, there is. Well, if you know, if you're familiar with them.
[00:08:23.460] - Speaker 2
Yes. And if you get bitten by a snake, you can take a picture of the snake or kill it and take it to the hospital.
[00:08:32.970] - Speaker 1
It's also a good measure, of course.
[00:08:35.800] - Speaker 2
Yes, because it's important to know what kind of snake it is. But thank you very much.
[00:08:41.010] - Speaker 1
I don't have any more. Sure.
