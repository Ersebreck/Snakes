Interview 151 3-04-25-04 & 05 – Severia (2 people)
[00:00:00.210] - Speaker 3
And what's your name?
[00:00:01.510] - Speaker 1
José Vicente Pava.
[00:00:03.230] - Speaker 3
How old are you?
[00:00:04.870] - Speaker 1
Sixty-four.
[00:00:06.250] - Speaker 3
What do you do for a living? If you work, that is.
[00:00:08.460] - Speaker 1
Here, I'm involved in farm work, agriculture. We're working right now in this area where we work. Right now we're involved with the countryside. I really like the countryside, so I see that life in the countryside is very beautiful, knowing how to live in the countryside. We don't have the stress that we have in the city. That bored me in the city, that everyone is always rushing around, stressed about everything. If not, then you have to pay for services, and if you don't have money, you have to cut back to pay for services, like transportation. And in Trasacán, here, I don't know, I consider myself to live very well here in the countryside. I pay rent here, I rent this place and I pay rent, but I live well. I live close to civilization. I need to move further out, further into the countryside, further out there, or I want to move to the city. I'm a bit strategic. I'm close to the main road.
[00:01:35.267] - Speaker 1
So, I live very well. And that's it, right now we're What's that called? The pigs. I don't know, it has a name.
[00:01:46.010] - Speaker 1
I don't remember. Fisicultura? No, no. Is fisicultura the fish thing? Fish. This is called I don't remember, actually. And we're working on this project to have chickens, pigs, chickens, all that stuff.
[00:02:07.950] - Speaker 3
Good.
[00:02:09.620] - Speaker 1
Yes, so we're based here, we're renting, we'll see how it goes. How long will we stay here? I mean, we've been here with her, based here day and night, for a month, a long month, we were hoping to stay here because we've already been here for about 20 months. But then, since we had a little business there in Carmen, we worked there, but we realized that it wasn't for us, like I said, all that stress and traveling day and night, getting up early to come here. So I said, "No, let's stay here." And we're here working, we'll see how it goes. So far, as I said, we've been here a month and we're starting to get organized and, as I said, we want to organize, build the sheds, get some chickens, pigs, I already have some piglets there, and we're getting there.
[00:03:18.890] - Speaker 3
Are you married or single?
[00:03:21.660] - Speaker 1
I live in a common-law relationship.
[00:03:24.430] - Speaker 3
Do you have children?
[00:03:25.990] - Speaker 1
Two children, but they are of legal age.
[00:03:29.700] - Speaker 3
And do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here?
[00:03:36.110] - Speaker 1
Sure, mother. Let a snake bite him. There are a lot of big ones around here, the kind that bite and kill. I've seen it happen. I've seen people get bitten and die. Yes, even on the farm where I used to work, there were a lot of snakes there. We were saved several times from those bites, but some of the other snakes, those very fierce ones, the ones we call "talla X." Yes, so I am aware of that, that a bite from that animal, or any animal, even a spider, that spider, and sometimes spiders too. Yes, scorpions. You're bound to That's what you have to expect in the countryside, in the middle of lots of little animals, scorpions. I don't know what you call them. I call them scorpions, I don't know what you call them, how you say each one... I don't know what else you call them. Scorpions have always been called that.
[00:04:38.940] - Speaker 3
The scorpion?
[00:04:40.220] - Speaker 1
The scorpion, that's the one. The scorpion, that's another little animal that also stings you. It makes you sleep for 24 hours, but you can't touch it. So, that happens. Good afternoon. Yes, that happens. So, there's a lot In the countryside, you're exposed to a lot of stings. For example, at this time of day there are a lot of mosquitoes, right? Mosquitoes, gnats, zancudos. We're in the countryside, but you kind of get used to it. You adapt to it. Like the reslano says, a pack mule. You adapt to everything. I'm from the countryside, but they took me away when I was very young. I went to the city and found my wife. I lived in Bogotá for many years. And after a while, I got bored with the city and came back to the countryside. After I reached a certain age, I came back to the countryside and, to this day, I feel very good here. Yes. The food is healthier, more...
[00:06:01.208] - Speaker 1
You eat less chemicals, because we grow our own food. Nowadays, with chickens and hens, you don't... It's more natural, you eat more natural food.
[00:06:15.420] - Speaker 1
That plantains, that cassava, that all that stuff So, I see that life in the countryside is very beautiful, that there are many people who say no, that you live in the countryside, but if you analyze it, life in the countryside is beautiful. I go to Bogotá, but my life changes in an instant, because I start to get stressed out, about everything, about everything. That you get robbed, that there are cars, that there aren't many things. You leave and see those traffic jams and you spend hours there and you can't... Not here, you have your motorbike or your horse, or you can walk. And you go more peacefully. Me, honestly, mom, I live very well here. I don't know if it's because of my age or what, but the city doesn't appeal to me anymore. I go because Bogotá gave me many good things, many, many good things. Thank God, I have my little pension that I got from working there in Bogotá. I managed to pay into my pension fund.
[00:07:35.903] - Speaker 1
But I'm not going to die yet, I'm still working as normal. You don't work like you're 40 anymore, you don't, because you always say no, but you start slowing down.
[00:07:50.530] - Speaker 1
You start to slow down, you start to give up. No matter how much you want to say, "No, that's not true." I'm starting to get in shape. Starting to work out, you already I get tired too. I get tired with the climbing, the lifting, the turning, and the moving, just like before. I don't think so. And I'd like to do it, but I can't, I can see that I can't. So, you have to be aware of that.
[00:08:23.540] - Speaker 3
And have any of your animals been bitten by a snake here?
[00:08:29.660] - Speaker 1
Not that I've noticed here, no. No, well, no. Before, where I worked on a farm, over there, I spent 10 years working on a farm and several people got bitten.
[00:08:43.520] - Speaker 3
Yes.
[00:08:45.040] - Speaker 1
Some were saved, others left.
[00:08:51.830] - Speaker 3
And do you know how to prevent or avoid getting bitten for being faithful?
[00:08:55.560] - Speaker 1
No, Mom, I don't know anything, I really don't.
[00:08:59.550] - Speaker 3
Okay.
[00:09:00.140] - Speaker 1
I don't know anything about that. I don't know how, or how to prevent it, or what to do if it does happen.
[00:09:08.310] - Speaker 3
Yes.
[00:09:09.000] - Speaker 1
Yes, even here, around here, sometimes they go out. Sometimes they go out. But I say no, nothing. They tell me that the gel from the borugo is a good countermeasure. But in one case
[00:09:30.700] - Speaker 3
They say yes.
[00:09:32.220] - Speaker 1
In a case where a comparison, if one of those snakes were to bite me right now, I wouldn't have anything to
[00:09:40.810] - Speaker 3
But before a snake bite, how do you prevent bites? How do you avoid snake bites, whether you have methods or not, it doesn't matter. And what would you do if you were bitten by a snake?
[00:10:04.340] - Speaker 1
What would you do? Well, one thing It's like when I was on the farm and a mare bit off this finger. There's nothing you can do. That's how it is, you bite it, you know it's a poisonous animal, that it will kill you. Then, I don't know, honestly, I don't know how you would react in that situation. I was on the farm one Saturday, riding a horse with a mare. The mare was a little stubborn, I was carrying a load, and I was riding. So, I sent her ahead, because you always send the horse with the load ahead. I threw the saddle over her like this, grabbed the bridle like this, grabbed the head of the saddle to get on the horse I was riding. And as I was getting on the mare, she bolted like this, and her head got tangled up. But that ripped my finger off like this. I was riding, it was nighttime, around seven o'clock in the evening. Then, I didn't see it, I felt the panel, but I didn't think the mare had ripped off my finger.
[00:11:15.717] - Speaker 1
So, I went to grab the saddle to get down, so that the load would turn around with the... The mare turned around like that and the load turned around again, she turned around like that and the load she was carrying turned around.
[00:11:33.820] - Speaker 1
So, I went to grab the head of the chair, but then I saw that I couldn't do it, I wasn't squeezing, I was holding the head there with these three, four fingers, but I wasn't squeezing the head of the chair. So I got down on this side like this, I had a little knife that I had used on my cell phone one day, I took it out and shone it on it and he said: No, my little finger is hanging like this, the skin is hanging down to here. I almost fainted, brother, when I saw that, I was so scared. So, I say that's what a snake bite feels like, if it's just one, when you see it like that, you feel like you're in a tunnel, the shock, the shock is so intense, and you're left like that. So, I say let a snake bite you. You go crazy. Not for me, because you don't have the countermeasure. After a bite
[00:12:34.040] - Speaker 3
Good. After a snake bite, would you go to the hospital or to the doctor?
[00:12:40.330] - Speaker 1
Sure, Mom. Yes, play.
[00:12:42.610] - Speaker 3
Where? In Carmen or here in the county?
[00:12:45.650] - Speaker 1
Well, one here, let's say I put my EPS in Girardón.
[00:12:52.100] - Speaker 2
But let's get closer.
[00:12:54.520] - Speaker 1
The closest, yes, because that already counts as
[00:12:58.640] - Speaker 2
Yes, they will assist you immediately.
[00:13:00.160] - Speaker 1
Yes, that's considered an emergency. An emergency, of course. Yes, for emergencies, they'll treat you anywhere. But you know that here in Cunday or here in Carmen, no, they'll just give you a painkiller.
[00:13:13.450] - Speaker 2
No, all hospitals have anti-emergency pay, all of them.
[00:13:20.010] - Speaker 1
Yes, well, I don't know. The truth is, it's not that it's
[00:13:23.090] - Speaker 2
They must have salaries for everything. All hospitals do.
[00:13:30.890] - Speaker 3
So, would you trust the hospital, Carmen, and Kundai to cure a snake bite?
[00:13:37.030] - Speaker 1
Sure, yeah. Once you're here, you start looking for the exit, right?
[00:13:43.140] - Speaker 2
Sure, the closest ones are there because of the quick effect, that's why. But here, throughout the hospital, there are some in Bogotá. In Bogotá, there are almost no hydra snakes. Hydra snakes in Bogotá are cazablas, which means they are already cazablas. But they are no longer poisonous. But that's because of the law, which requires them to have a lot of antivenom available.
[00:14:11.940] - Speaker 3
And if you need to go to the hospital, is that difficult for you or easy?
[00:14:18.780] - Speaker 1
No, it's easy, thank God, because I have transportation or there's someone who can take me. Yes, that's right.
[00:14:31.010] - Speaker 3
Okay.
[00:14:32.420] - Speaker 2
Because running is okay, I tell him.
[00:14:34.420] - Speaker 1
Yes.
[00:14:35.770] - Speaker 2
Of course, at that moment, I imagine you feel desperate, right?
[00:14:38.950] - Speaker 1
Of course not. I didn't tell her when I got there that it had been torn off, and I said, "What? What about me? What happened to me?" I was stunned. I looked at my hand, and I could only see four fingers, like this. Did someone come and move it? No, she tore it off. The rope got tangled around the head, and someone came rushing over. Look. They had to do two surgeries on me to be able to
[00:14:59.370] - Speaker 2
Did you take your finger off?
[00:15:00.520] - Speaker 1
Yes, no, my finger was left hanging here, this little piece of skin here, it was left behind. And they did it to me there during the pandemic. Before that, I had to leave because I was there all night and the ambulance didn't come to They couldn't get me a transfer to where I needed to go. That's what happened to me there, and I had to pay for a car from Cundalla to take me to Melgar. And from there I left for Bogotá. They treated me there at the cardiovascular hospital in San Mateo. There, and that was during the pandemic, and that's how it was. And they wouldn't treat me because there wasn't... Wasn't there a surgeon? No, there was a surgeon, but there wasn't... A group to take me to a place to stay, what do you call that? There were no beds? There were no beds, there was nothing. And there I was with my finger like that, scared, and I said, "No, but I told them, 'You're going to let me die with my finger like that.
[00:15:57.230] - Speaker 2
My brother's hair was cut, and they put him on an endless loop. He took it in, and they wouldn't take it back. Right? Too late.
[00:16:07.320] - Speaker 1
Yes, this one was ripped out.
[00:16:08.930] - Speaker 2
He's going without the macho man, he's going
[00:16:11.500] - Speaker 1
This one was torn off here. And the tendon was left right there. But I was left with I have it there and I can't bend it. I have my little finger and I can't bend it because it was left... But at least... But it's there. It's there, yes. I feel like it's there. No, no, no, my brother, if you need to. Yes, I have it there, I'm not squeezing it. No, I'm not squeezing it because I have it there. But I'm thankful that at least I have it there. I can't bend it like this, like this, straight, there. I move it, but no... And then, if that's all, that's it. And I got desperate. I went. When I realized, I must have been like this, I left the load there with the horses, and I called the man, a man from the village who has a truck, to come and pick me up where I was. And he came and brought me to Cundall.
[00:17:07.082] - Speaker 1
He came and picked me up and brought me to Cundall. So, that day they left me there that night. That was at 7:00 p.m. on a Sunday, they left me there in the town, here in Cundall.
[00:17:19.910] - Speaker 1
And the next day, they couldn't find me The ambulance? Yes. No, they couldn't find me to take me somewhere else, to see where they were going to send me. So, I told them, "No, I'm going to Bogotá, even if I have to pay for it myself." And so, he says, I got a car and paid for the ride to Melgar, and there I took a bus to Bogotá. And there I arrived at the cardiovascular hospital in Bogotá. Yes, they treated me there and did an exam. They removed the bandages that had been placed on me with some sticks. Are there gauze pads? Yes, but they almost made me cry when they removed them. That blood stuck to it, dried up, and wouldn't come off, man. And they made me look at it... No, I was desperate to get that blood off and to be able to move my finger. But no, because I feel it numb, you know? I feel it numb, but it's there.
[00:18:21.843] - Speaker 1
But it's there. Yes, miss.
[00:18:24.340] - Speaker 3
And where do you feel you are most likely to be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:18:34.560] - Speaker 1
Mother, it is because sometimes they come out of the houses around here. They sometimes come out of the houses.
[00:18:40.600] - Speaker 2
She goes in looking for mice. When she gets to the annuals, for example, she might like to eat a lot of salamander. Then they climb up. A long time ago, there was a huge, size X large one. We caught her getting in through the window over there, in that room, with a man named Pedro, who lived here. So we caught her in a sack and gave her to another man, a veterinarian, who buys them and takes them away. But she does. The thing is, you can't ride motorcycles near the windows, because they climb on the motorcycle and get in through the windows. She was climbing onto the motorcycle. When I passed by, I saw her. But she's big, thick. I mean, she was huge Before, there were chestnut trees here.
[00:19:42.380] - Speaker 1
Yes, no, but they come out here. Yes, of course. So you always have to be careful. You always have to be careful. You can't trust them too much, because they come out, mamita. And that could happen to you at any time when you bump into one. Yes. No, here, I've had them, but up here, but not size X, other ones. But where I was working on the farm, there, every few minutes, they would stick out an inch, and you had to deal with those snakes. So, you tell me, you don't have one, you don't know how to fix that, at that moment, you can't call your neighbor and say, "Come help me."
[00:20:25.200] - Speaker 2
No.
[00:20:26.160] - Speaker 1
Once, back on the farm, those foreign bees were buzzing around and there was a honeycomb up high, and they were cutting down the tree, and when it fell, it fell on the boy who was cutting it. Oh, my God! They followed him for more than a kilometer, and you saw how they turned on him. That boy looked like a monster. What did I do? The boy went home and was desperate on his motorcycle: "Come on, stop here for Kunday." They gave him drugs for that, because he smelled like a very desperate boy.
[00:21:03.580] - Speaker 2
And they are poisonous; they kill.
[00:21:05.740] - Speaker 1
That was a terrible thing. They follow you like Then there's that, too, let's add those bee stings. That's tough, too.
[00:21:17.130] - Speaker 2
Yes. I haven't seen it. The Abricana.
[00:21:19.430] - Speaker 3
Yes, him.
[00:21:20.210] - Speaker 2
She's the one who kills them. And do you know how to identify poisonous snakes or snakes that are venomous?
[00:21:31.020] - Speaker 3
How do you identify different snakes?
[00:21:35.260] - Speaker 1
Well, I'm talking about size X. There are others that we call Look at its head, this one really looks like it. The eye? One that sometimes seems to stop like that, and you look at it and say, "What's that called?" There are several snakes like that.
[00:21:52.690] - Speaker 2
But generally here, the venomous snake is brightly colored. The venomous snake is gray in color, not bright. Rather, it is dull, black. For example, the coffee is bright. And the X looks bright. And for example, the corala.
[00:22:20.870] - Speaker 1
The coral I'm talking about. That coral.
[00:22:24.920] - Speaker 2
And she's tough, one of those you can't just ignore.
[00:22:29.180] - Speaker 1
The coral is dangerous. There's no antidote for that. Is the coral the one with red and black? Yes, that's the one.
[00:22:32.350] - Speaker 2
There's no anti-fever serum for that. And she's from a climate She's not from this climate, she's from a colder climate than this. She's from a climate where bananas and coffee grow, but it's much colder than this. But you have to be careful with her, because she's aggressive. She'll bite you if you step on her or pick her up. But she won't attack you, she won't attack you. Are you the boss, Ringo? She doesn't attack, and all the snakes run away when they hear noise. Unless you've stepped on her, and she's brave, then she'll face you, whether you've stepped on her or teased her. Because when it's a snake, it's true that when you tease them, don't think they'll back down. They'll face you.
[00:23:30.280] - Speaker 1
Yes, there are a lot of snakes, that's true. When you talk about snakes of that size, from around here, they're fierce. That one over there, you get close and it'll bite you for no reason. Yes, of course. It strikes like this. I'm really scared of that snake over there.
[00:23:43.880] - Speaker 2
I found one there, remember I told you in the bathroom? Yes. No, I took it out, turned it upside down. I don't kill them, I don't kill them because I am... I used to kill them. When I came back, when I first got here, I told everyone to kill them. But then I found out and the old lady said, "No, they never attack you." She defends herself. I mean, that's what she says. And it's very important to be careful not to step on her, not to go near her. No, because if she's there, she runs away from the noise. But when you step on her or something, she responds. She responds by biting, like I do when I have to... Yes, well, thank you very much.
[00:24:35.000] - Speaker 3
I have no further questions, but do you have anything else to say about snakes or your knowledge? Anything else to add?
[00:24:41.300] - Speaker 1
No, mother. Actually, I'm from Cajú, but I can move like a snake, yes.
[00:24:47.200] - Speaker 2
There is a three-headed snake. Almost no one has seen it. I saw it. And it's this big. And here, here.
[00:24:59.490] - Speaker 1
Three heads?
[00:25:00.180] - Speaker 2
Three heads, super. So it's super, but it's not super. Three heads, and the heads are big on each side, one. I mean, in Lívano, in Tolima, where I'm from, next to the ravine. It was in a hole. I didn't kill it because it gave me When I had it, the several, not even I... I saw it like that, yellow, shiny and a little brown. And a very bright yellow. I mean, it was very poisonous. When the color is very bright, it's super poisonous. There are others there. There's one called the machete back. She's fierce and chases you. If you tease her or something, you have to fight her. We also found that one one day while fishing for trout, by pure chance, and they travel in pairs, never alone. And just by chance, I don't know how I hit her, and she's green, super shiny, green with black spots. Just imagine, the triangle is normal, but it's a triangle that moves.
[00:26:26.485] - Speaker 2
And here it has black spots and the rest is... And she... I don't know how I hit her with the fishing rod.
[00:26:37.740] - Speaker 2
And once she sent me out and I ran away, and she came after us. And two were already coming. It's called lomo machete. My dad said, "May she rest in peace. If you leave, she'll fight you until she kills you. Because if you let your guard down, she'll be watching you. That's what lomo machete is like, so be careful with her."
[00:27:06.350] - Speaker 3
Interesting, yes.
[00:27:07.960] - Speaker 1
Didn't you hear that snake, the toche, what they call the toche?
[00:27:10.880] - Speaker 2
That's another one, yes. The toche.
[00:27:12.820] - Speaker 1
They were like sticks, get rid of them.
[00:27:16.430] - Speaker 2
But she wasn't very fat. She hits you on the feet with her toy, she passes the birds. And then she jumps from one side to the other. She ties herself with her tail and jumps. And when she's tied at the front, then you go over and hit her really hard on the side.
[00:27:35.620] - Speaker 1
He's boarding.
[00:27:38.110] - Speaker 3
Beautiful. Interesting, yes. It's important to know what to do after a snake bite. It's important to go straight to the hospital, and it's important to know what kind of snake bit you, because there are different antivenoms for different snakes. You can take a picture of the snake, or you can kill it and take it to the hospital. That's the most important thing to know about snake bites.
[00:28:10.400] - Speaker 1
What kind of snake bites you?
[00:28:12.060] - Speaker 3
Yes, exactly. But thank you very much for your time. That's all I have. Very kind of you. I'm glad. Thank you very much.
[00:28:21.930] - Speaker 1
Anyway, he's never brought it up. And then, the topics, right? No. The topics are kind of not their thing But they're good, right?
[00:28:32.480] - Speaker 2
But you're doing research on that.
[00:28:35.130] - Speaker 3
Yes, my project is about snake bites and how people prevent snake bites here in the countryside.
[00:28:43.920] - Speaker 2
Yes, in the countryside.
[00:28:45.230] - Speaker 3
Yes, exactly. Yes, because there are so many snakes here, it's incredible.
[00:28:49.800] - Speaker 1
Yes, here, here around here, always the countryside.
[00:28:52.080] - Speaker 2
Yes, there it is.
[00:28:53.290] - Speaker 1
