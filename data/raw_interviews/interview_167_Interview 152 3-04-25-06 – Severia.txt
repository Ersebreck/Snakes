[00:00:42.290] - Speaker 2
Yes, there are quite a few animals of different breeds. There are tallas, there are granadillas that bite. Granadilla. There are mitaos that cross with tallas, and those already have canines, so they are dangerous. There are also corales. There are different species of these animals here in this village.

And have any of your animals been bitten by a snake, such as a pet or livestock?
[00:01:31.780] - Speaker 2
Cattle. Quite a few animals have died here after being bitten by tallas. My sister was also bitten by a talla.
[00:01:47.020] - Speaker 1
Did she go to the hospital?
[00:01:48.720] - Speaker 2
She went to the hospital in Melgar and from there she was transferred to Girardoa, where she spent about eight days in the hospital.
[00:01:57.960] - Speaker 1
How long ago?
[00:01:59.560] - Speaker 2
About seven years ago, I think.
[00:02:04.580] - Speaker 1
And what happened with the bite? Did she go out into the field?
[00:02:08.710] - Speaker 2
It was right here on the farm.
[00:02:12.160] - Speaker 1
And she stepped on him?
[00:02:15.270] - Speaker 2
Yes, she was going to pick some fruit, avocados, and she was looking at the tree and didn't notice and stepped on it. And since the lake was right there, she went into the water.
[00:02:29.920] - Speaker 1
That's too bad.
[00:02:33.960] - Speaker 2
But she's fine. Since it's already getting dark when she leaves, around 6:00, they start moving from one place to another.
[00:02:45.410] - Speaker 1
But she's fine now, your sister.
[00:02:49.040] - Speaker 2
She did, but her foot always felt numb. But thank God she's fine now. Yes, thank God.
[00:02:59.210] - Speaker 1
And do you know how to prevent or avoid a snake bite before a snake bite?
[00:03:07.620] - Speaker 2
Yes, there are some, as I told you. They say that with borugo bile you have to take precautions with that Take a few drops of bile, that helps while you get to the hospital.
[00:03:29.190] - Speaker 1
Okay. And do you have methods to prevent a snake bite before it happens?
[00:03:40.960] - Speaker 2
Take precautions in case you get bitten by an animal like that. You have to be very careful where you go, because sometimes they even come into people's yards. At night, you have to go out with a flashlight and shine it everywhere, because you never know where they are, they move from place to place.
[00:04:05.460] - Speaker 1
And what would you do if a snake bit you?
[00:04:09.280] - Speaker 2
Well, the first thing to do is go to a hospital, the closest one you can get to.
[00:04:17.970] - Speaker 1
Would you go to the hospital in Kundaio or Carmen?
[00:04:21.650] - Speaker 2
Kundaio or Melgar, because Melgar is appropriate here.
[00:04:26.640] - Speaker 1
And would you trust the hospitals in Melgar and Kundaio to heal you?
[00:04:30.590] - Speaker 2
Yes, because there is a place called Tolemaida, where the battalion is located, and they keep that serum there to administer to people, so they supply it to the hospital.
[00:04:48.780] - Speaker 1
And if you need to go to the hospital, is it easy for you or difficult?
[00:04:54.410] - Speaker 2
Well, when there is someone, a neighbor, who can take you there, the fastest way possible. That's how it was with me, the fastest way possible.
[00:05:02.300] - Speaker 3
And where do you feel most likely to be bitten by a snake?
[00:05:08.530] - Speaker 1
In the countryside or at home?
[00:05:10.970] - Speaker 2
Anywhere. Since they move around, you never know. Sometimes they get in under the doors. So you never know. That's why at night it's better to turn on the lights to make sure there aren't any animals inside or outside the house.
[00:05:33.470] - Speaker 1
Do you know how to identify poisonous snakes or snakes that are venomous?
[00:05:39.350] - Speaker 2
Yes, because some of them aren't poisonous. But I don't remember what they're called.
[00:05:47.630] - Speaker 1
No problem. It's difficult, there are many different types. And how do you identify the different snakes? By their color, by By their color and because they're quicker to get away, they don't look for the size they're looking for.
[00:06:07.890] - Speaker 2
They have a common expression here that they use to say "to get chipped." As if to be ready for defense, they get chipped, that's how they say it.
[00:06:24.640] - Speaker 1
I have no further questions, but do you have anything else to say about snakes or your knowledge of snakes, or anything else?
[00:06:38.200] - Speaker 2
Well, I was asking if there was anything you could do to make them leave, or something, so that they wouldn't look for houses. So, yes, that's what I wanted to know. Yes.
[00:07:00.200] - Speaker 1
Yes. Well, the most important thing after a snake bite is to go straight to the hospital. And it's important to know what kind of snake bit you, because there are different antivenoms for different snakes. You can take a picture of the snake or you can kill it and take it to the hospital. But that's the most important thing. It's also important to know that tourniquets are not recommended. Many people believe that they are a good way to treat a snake bite, but it's not a good idea because the blood needs to circulate in your body and you could lose a leg or an arm if you use a tourniquet. And for prevention, it's important to wear boots in the countryside. It's important Yes, exactly. Have a flashlight at night, look around carefully at night and early in the morning as well. And it's important to clean your house because snakes like trash a lot, they like to hide in trash. And yes, that's the most important thing to know.
[00:08:41.000] - Speaker 2
Thank you, very kind. Yes, yes.
[00:08:45.120] - Speaker 1
Thank you very much. You too. All done.
