What's your name?
[00:00:02.170] - Speaker 1
Julian.
[00:00:03.100] - Speaker 2
And how old are you?
[00:00:06.460] - Speaker 1
42.
[00:00:07.910] - Speaker 2
What do you do for a living?
[00:00:09.490] - Speaker 1
In the countryside, in the neighborhood trade.
[00:00:13.010] - Speaker 2
Are you married or single?
[00:00:15.190] - Speaker 1
Common-law marriage.
[00:00:16.390] - Speaker 2
Do you have children?
[00:00:17.930] - Speaker 1
No, not with my partner. I have a daughter, but she's not mine, she's just my partner's.
[00:00:21.970] - Speaker 2
And how many years have you lived here?
[00:00:26.110] - Speaker 1
I've been here for about two years. Yes, because before I was working on César Rincón's farm. Then, I stopped working with César Rincón and came here for a few days, then a few weeks.
[00:00:43.930] - Speaker 2
So, do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:49.160] - Speaker 1
Well, anyway, because Well, around here they do live. Around here, what you see most is the choir and the carving. Other than that, as far as I know, from what I've seen walking around, I haven't seen anything else except for the cascabel, because the cascabel is mostly found around Girarodó, towards Tocaima, there you can find cascabel. Around here, they carve it, and over there, coral. And granadilla.
[00:01:20.960] - Speaker 2
And have any of your animals been bitten by a snake, such as a pet or livestock?
[00:01:28.540] - Speaker 1
No. Suddenly, when I was on a farm where I don't know if there are a lot of snakes, because at least when it's really hot, they look for the riverbank for the coolness. So, there were several snakes biting the cattle.
[00:01:48.430] - Speaker 2
And do you know how to prevent or avoid a snake bite before you get bitten?
[00:01:57.740] - Speaker 1
Around here, more than one person says that Y la contra, suddenly, that it bites you so quickly, that they took the borugo gel, what the borugo gel brings. It's like an oil that you stir and drink while they take you to the doctor. That's like a countermeasure, while they suddenly take you to the doctor.
[00:02:23.090] - Speaker 2
And do you have any methods for preventing snake bites, such as before a bite?
[00:02:30.450] - Speaker 1
No. No? Okay.
[00:02:33.290] - Speaker 2
And what would you do if a snake bit you?
[00:02:38.480] - Speaker 1
They say that depending on the part, you should put one on, make a tourniquet, tie it up, and have someone take you to the hospital to see if they can give you that serum they give now, which is the antidote, I think, for the bite.
[00:02:55.950] - Speaker 2
And which hospital would you go to?
[00:02:58.480] - Speaker 1
Suddenly, Girardot. Why Girardot? Or El Espinal. Why? Excuse me, I was going here. Because those are the closest hospitals, maybe Milgar. But anyway, if it's a really big bite, maybe Milgar, if they'll treat you. So, if they don't have the serum to apply to the bite, I think they'll send you to Girardó or Ibaque.
[00:03:22.660] - Speaker 2
But you wouldn't go to Carmen or anyone else, would you? Not to the hospitals.
[00:03:26.670] - Speaker 1
No, because it would be, at least, I mean, if you get bitten by a snake, go to Kunday, I don't think they have the serum for a nebra bite. So, I think they'll send you to Girardó or Melgar or maybe Ibagué. And then, maybe to the nearest hospitals there.
[00:03:46.590] - Speaker 2
And if you need to go to the hospital, is that difficult for you or easy?
[00:03:52.100] - Speaker 1
Well, it's always complicated around here. Around here, it's always like I mean, first of all, you know that in a case like that, the most important thing is a cell phone, and the cell phone signal is terrible around here. So, it can get complicated, because the first thing you have to do is call an ambulance or something to get the patient out who's been bitten by one of those animals, but around here, the first thing is that the signal is bad, the cell phone signal is bad. So, it can be risky for an animal to bite someone out there until they get them out, and I think there's always a delay.
[00:04:40.080] - Speaker 2
And where do you feel most likely to be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:04:49.230] - Speaker 1
No, it's always like in the countryside, because you always keep your house well organized and clean. And sometimes you clean around with a CPM or something like that, so that they stay away too. Or suddenly you take the garlic skin and peel it, the onion, the little shell, the onion, and you throw it away, you put it on to burn and that's like another thing, like anise, that keeps them away too.
[00:05:18.020] - Speaker 2
And do you know how to identify poisonous and non-poisonous snakes?
[00:05:24.590] - Speaker 1
Of course, because at least around here, you know the size, you see it and you know it's a big one and that it's dangerous, meaning you can't play with it. Or the coral snake too. But the rest are out there, but those are the ones that hunt around there, little birds, around those hunters, but they're not fierce anymore, like the big snakes and the coral snakes, which are around here, because this climate is a moderate climate, so snakes do come out around here. But they all go further away, over there, in the ravines, in the woods. You know, if you go in there looking for an animal, looking for cattle, looking for a horse, something you lost there. Or maybe you need a stick and you go to cut one and suddenly there's one there. Yes, it's risky that it might sting you, but otherwise, around here they keep it clean and everything. They keep it like over there, they live there, like over there in the woods, where it's kind of fishy, wooded.
[00:06:29.740] - Speaker 1
But not the rest around here. Maybe they'll come, but only in small numbers, and small ones at that, not big ones like the ones you find in the woods.
[00:06:41.890] - Speaker 2
And how do you identify the snakes? And why are they different? By their color, their heads, their skin?
[00:06:49.770] - Speaker 1
The thing is, the size, size X, she has a G X on top. And the coral, yes, it comes in red with black spots and a little sparkle, like white, a few spots. So, you know them, you know them. You know the coral. I mean, like people, you always see them in the field, you can tell which one is poisonous and which one isn't. And the poisonous one for me is the size here and the coral. But you don't find them very often, very rarely.
[00:07:26.170] - Speaker 2
And do you know of a case of a snake bite? No, no, no.
[00:07:32.590] - Speaker 1
Okay. No.
[00:07:35.240] - Speaker 2
Okay. Well, thank you very much. I don't have any more questions, but do you have anything else to say about snakes or your knowledge of snakes or anything else?
[00:07:43.660] - Speaker 1
No, at the moment I don't have much more knowledge, so let's say no, no. Okay.
[00:07:49.380] - Speaker 2
And it is important to know after a snake bite, it is important and the right to go to the hospital.
[00:07:55.620] - Speaker 1
Yes, of course.
[00:07:56.350] - Speaker 2
And it's important to know which snake killed you, because there are different antivenoms for different snakes. You can take a photo of the snake or you can kill it and take it to the hospital. And yes, that's the most important thing to know.
[00:08:14.720] - Speaker 1
Well, you have to watch out for when it bites you, because if a bug suddenly bites you in the dark or somewhere else that's dark, it's difficult, yes. And if you don't have anything to light it up with, what can you do? She leaves and you're left with the bite.
[00:08:28.120] - Speaker 2
It's difficult, yes.
[00:08:29.810] - Speaker 1
Oh, I see, during the day, yes, during the day, if it's not too bad, because they used to say: At least I'm not going to cover it up and encourage it to bite you. You'll be fine in five minutes. Because the poison, I mean, the poison, imagine, like a snake bite and your blood, they're not compatible. So, the blood fights to escape the poison. That's why the person who is bitten starts to bleed from their ears or eyes, because the blood flees from the poison and the poison seeks the blood. So, they are like enemies between the snake's poison and your blood or the animal's blood, because at least one bite, and if you don't give them medicine, in half an hour or an hour, they start the same thing, bleeding from the eyes, the nose, and everywhere, because you start to break down the pores. In other words, it's the same power of the poison and the blood fleeing from the poison.
[00:09:35.280] - Speaker 1
So that's why the animal always jumps. And that's why more than one person knows that it bites snakes. Why? Because the animal falls and immediately starts bleeding from its eyes, nose, and ears. So, a snake bites it. But that happens when the animal is already on the ground. It's practically already dying.
[00:09:58.800] - Speaker 2
Yes. Yes. Yes.
