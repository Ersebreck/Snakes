And if you need to go to the hospital, is it difficult for you or is it easy? To get there?
[00:01:32.330] - Speaker 2
If you need to go to the hospital, is it difficult for you or is it easy?
[00:01:37.420] - Speaker 1
Well, it's a bit complicated here because of transportation. Yes, of course. Because here, since it's the countryside, cars take a long time to pass by.
[00:01:43.740] - Speaker 2
Sure, yes. And where do you feel you're most likely to get bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:01:53.220] - Speaker 1
They've gotten into the house. But it's like you've gotten five of them in there. But it's like you're At any moment, one of them could sting him. I'm saying someone should watch him. Do you remember the day? Yes.
[00:02:12.580] - Speaker 2

Well, more or less talla X, and kind of like the coral one.
[00:02:22.770] - Speaker 2
Okay, yes. And how do you identify snakes? By their color, by their skin?
[00:02:28.300] - Speaker 1
Because of their color. And also, many say that because of their diamond-shaped heads, they are more dangerous. That's what they tell me.
[00:02:35.680] - Speaker 2
And do you know of any cases of snake bites?
[00:02:40.480] - Speaker 1
The wife of Yes.
[00:02:42.780] - Speaker 2
Well, I don't have any more questions, but do you have anything else to say about snakes, your knowledge of snakes, anything else?
[00:02:50.850] - Speaker 1
What do you do when you get bitten and you're far away? What should you do?
[00:02:55.870] - Speaker 2
Okay, yes.
[00:02:58.160] - Speaker 1
So, what can one do here while waiting for a center to arrive?
[00:03:03.460] - Speaker 2
Yes. After a bite, the most important thing is to go straight to the hospital. And it's important to know what kind of snake bit you, because there are different antivenoms for different snakes. You can take a photo of the snake, you can kill it and take it to the hospital. And tourniquets are not recommended because the blood needs to circulate in the body. And what else? For prevention, it's important to wear long boots in the countryside. You'll need a flashlight at night, but don't take anything with you that you can't carry.
[00:03:50.820] - Speaker 1
It's best to go downtown. Okay, sure.
[00:03:54.850] - Speaker 2
And yes, that's the most important thing to know. And snakes like to hide in trash. It's important to clean your house, it's important. But yes, that's the information. But thank you very much, I don't have any more questions. Very kind of you.
[00:04:19.750] - Speaker 1
With much delay.
