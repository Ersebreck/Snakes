[00:00:30.800] - Speaker 2
And today you were almost bitten by a snake?
[00:00:35.700] - Speaker 1
Yes, I was almost bitten by a snake.
[00:00:36.840] - Speaker 2
What happened?
[00:00:37.950] - Speaker 1
It was really close by, right here, and I was here putting a string in place and it was wrapped around there. And I hadn't seen it. It was kind of dark, even though it was raining, and I was putting a string there. And then the boy arrived, the older one, right at that moment. When I went over there, to the other side of the string where I was going to make the holes, and the prison, the boy arrived and the car arrived behind him, the car with the materials. And then, just then, he said: The car is coming, the materials, and the boy arrived and said to me: Look, there's a snake, it almost bit you. And he came and killed it with a comb.
[00:01:08.700] - Speaker 2
Did you kill the snake?
[00:01:09.720] - Speaker 1
Yes, he killed her. She was long, she was like this, she was long.
[00:01:13.600] - Speaker 2
Was it a size issue?
[00:01:14.370] - Speaker 1
A size, yes. A size that is becoming dangerous.
[00:01:17.340] - Speaker 2
Was she smart or not? How was she smart?
[00:01:21.460] - Speaker 1
Yes, she arrived. And she was ready to throw because she was almost done She was ready to throw.
[00:01:30.060] - Speaker 2
Yes. And that's good. Thank God, don't die.
[00:01:33.530] - Speaker 1
No, thank God it wasn't the first day to pass something on to him.
[00:01:36.200] - Speaker 2
Yes.
[00:01:37.150] - Speaker 1
But this morning No, I hadn't worked for almost three weeks, but today I went to work and then one of those things happened. I've finished filling it out.
[00:01:46.400] - Speaker 2
And how do you know she was a size?
[00:01:49.940] - Speaker 1
Because when you see her, she's like an X, an X. So, you know what a tattoo is. A coral is the same thing, because the coral comes with red, over there on that side, there are corals by the house, where you were. One day I killed like two of them there. And the cat that was there, the cat over there, she's killed like six bitches. She's a killer of bitches. And that's why I keep the back clean and everything, because that's where the bitches hang out, they're everywhere. So, that's the problem.
[00:02:21.240] - Speaker 2
And do you know how to identify poisonous snakes? Yes, of course.
[00:02:26.420] - Speaker 1
I know how to identify poisonous curieras and novenenosas.
[00:02:30.930] - Speaker 2
And how do you identify snakes?
[00:02:32.360] - Speaker 1
Because of the color? Because of the color, yes. Size X has an X, so size X has an X, black and white, and that's it. And the coral one comes in red and black. And there's one that has something like a ponceña on the tail, that's the most braga, that's the most braga size. And there's one that's the candela, I don't know if it was braga too. And the bejuca, there's also a green bejuca. There at the house, a friend came and it was there in the sun, where there's a grapevine, it was all rolled up, not rolled up lengthwise. But at least the woman is afraid of it, almost, and he came and picked it up. And he came and hit it, he hit it against the stick, like this, he grabbed its tail and hit it against a stick that's there, and I hung the hand that hit it and killed it. But they say that they're also fierce, those curéras too. But they're not poisonous.
[00:03:24.833] - Speaker 1
They're not poisonous, esombrada, they also bite.
[00:03:28.310] - Speaker 2
Yes, of course.
[00:03:29.300] - Speaker 1
But they're not poisonous. And for example, the mitrago isn't poisonous either, because one bit me, down there, in the ravine. I went to cut some bananas, my uncle sent me to cut some bananas, and I went to cut some bananas. And when I was there, Pedro, the telephone, I worked with him, and then I went to cut some more bananas. He said, "Uncle, go cut a plate." No, we didn't go to cut anything. We cut a banana, and then we cut a plantain. I said, 'Go cut a plantain that's next to you. At the foot of a palm tree. And he's going to cut it for me, and I'll go over there. And when I put my foot down and went to swing the machete, the guy grabbed me here and bit me, but it was a big bite, like he didn't have any teeth. He bit me. But it looked like he had shaved it down, but no.
[00:04:19.625] - Speaker 1
And he bit me, and I didn't go to the hospital or anything. Luckily, there was a lemon tree, and one day it broke off and cut me, and blood was coming out, and he squeezed a lot of lemon on it. He tore my pants and everything because he was measuring it, because he said, "Here, there, that far."
[00:04:38.980] - Speaker 1
We were really low down. And I bled a lot, yes. And I scraped it and squeezed lemon on it and that was it. And no, I didn't go to the hospital, I took some medicine for the delay, no, I didn't go to the hospital. I took some medicine for the delay, no. I didn't go to the hospital, no. It's fine. But it's dangerous.
[00:04:52.660] - Speaker 2
Yes. And do you know how to prevent or avoid a snake bite?
[00:04:57.640] - Speaker 1
No, no. Otherwise They say that with the frost on the goruco, they talk to... But that's not certain.
[00:05:03.900] - Speaker 2
But before you get bitten by a snake, do you know how to avoid snakes?
[00:05:10.580] - Speaker 1
No, I don't know. I don't know how
[00:05:13.480] - Speaker 2
No.
[00:05:14.170] - Speaker 1
I don't know anything.
[00:05:15.980] - Speaker 2
And have any of your animals been bitten by a snake, such as a pet or livestock?
[00:05:24.770] - Speaker 1
No, I haven't seen it. I've seen cattle, but only when they're dead, because you never notice when a snake bites them. When the cattle were out there, around there, near the foot, they died. It killed two cows up there, on the hill, opposite where you are. It killed one first, and then the next day it killed another one, two, and they killed it, but it was just skin and bones. But then they shot it, they had to shoot it. They found the roll, they killed it. It was a very big one. There, at the neighbor's, over there, now here, they found a very big one. There in the lake, where we are, we're over there. A curacuta, you'd find it.
[00:06:05.430] - Speaker 2
And what would you do if a snake bit you?
[00:06:11.860] - Speaker 1
If they bite you on the leg, then it won't affect you. If you have a belt or a cord, stop the blood flow a little so that the poison doesn't spread quickly. That's the only way, because the rest of the poison will travel quickly through your veins.
[00:06:28.880] - Speaker 2
And would you go? Is he at the hospital?
[00:06:31.130] - Speaker 1
Yes, you would have to go to the hospital, because that's where you have to go to get the antivenom.
[00:06:36.650] - Speaker 2
Which hospital would you go to?
[00:06:39.010] - Speaker 1
Yes, the closest one, you should go to the closest one, the one that's closer so you can get there faster. Then, finally, give Y and from there, if it's serious, one on the other side, as soon as the ambulance arrives, one on the other side. When it's closer, you don't know which side it's going to bite you on, you don't know which side it's going to bite you on. If it's over here, for example, over there, it's better if it bites you there, because I've had to come to the nearest hospital. Because a woman died over there, she was bitten by a snake and it killed her. And over there, in Cunday, also at that time of day, a woman who had a little girl, about two years old, was able to take her to the bush and that, and she died here too. And the woman killed her too, she died too. And there was a little girl, about two and a half years old.
[00:07:27.277] - Speaker 1
And the man, that's more serious than a girl. And the girl was suffering there.
[00:07:31.960] - Speaker 2
And if you need to go to the hospital, is that difficult for you or easy?
[00:07:38.170] - Speaker 1
No, because it's difficult to go to the hospital, depending on where you are. I go there several times. Where you were, there's a ravine. So, I go to get food and you can encounter many snakes. The only good thing is that one day we went with a friend and found a bunch of carvings, too. And we're going to bring food. And I have some mangosteen sticks there, so you can bring mangosteen for food, bananas, plantains, cachaco. It's dangerous. I was planting there the other day, but you still have to be careful with the snakes. The snake missed me on the side, but that's not
[00:08:17.820] - Speaker 2
But do you have transportation to get to the hospital if you need to go?
[00:08:23.980] - Speaker 1
Well, the motorcycle, but if no one else can drive, because here at other doors, then you See what you can do. If you have pain like that, you can't even drive. How can you drive? If a stone hurts, you can't drive, you can't do anything. And you don't know where it's going to sting you, that's the problem. You can be crouching down, it stings your arm, your foot, you don't know where it stings. And just as it stings, the poison spreads. If it's higher up, the poison spreads faster through your heart and it can kill you.
[00:09:00.680] - Speaker 2
And where do you feel you are most likely to be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:09:07.260] - Speaker 1
That's everything, because they also come to the house. Yes, people in the house. Yes, here in a country house, a friend of mine who works there. I used to work there in Allina Vegas, the son, the husband of a woman from Moncada, his name is Iván. And they were in the pool and they were doing the accounts there, everything was clean and tidy. And when a cat came by, messing around, it had a snake in its mouth and it passed by that floor, where they were doing the accounts, on the clean floor, on the pavement, by the pool. And it passed by and the snake crossed into the hole and the man moved his foot and stepped on it once. And the man is going to die, this was on the trip, he had a garage. And his foot became like this, like a bench. And his people took him to the hospital, which was close by, here was the lake village, very close by.
[00:10:02.477] - Speaker 1
And here, with the impunity and snakes, you have to be careful. No, because they'll say, "No, no." And now with winter, there are bubbles from the culejeras everywhere. Because the culejeras are looking for that, where they won't get wet, to hide, they can even put you in a bed.
[00:10:20.730] - Speaker 1
You have to be careful with that. Snakes are very dangerous. The same goes for scorpions and everything else. Yes, of course. You have to shake out your bed and your shoes. If you're going to put on a pair of shoes, shake them, because snakes can get into them. There are big snakes and small snakes, and the small ones are the most dangerous.
[00:10:44.370] - Speaker 2
Well, I don't have any more questions, but you have more to say about snakes, your knowledge of snakes. Anything else to add?
[00:10:52.300] - Speaker 1
No. Snakes, yes. But one thing to prevent is that you don't know what to do to prevent a bite when you're not near a hospital, which may be very far away and you can't even Or you're alone and can't even move, that's the problem.
[00:11:11.370] - Speaker 2
Yes, of course.
[00:11:12.390] - Speaker 1
But if there were an anti-venom or some kind of capsule that you could put in, if the snake bit you, you would put it in. Or you would carry it with you and inject yourself. When you're in pain, you inject yourself wherever you want, in your leg, wherever you want, you inject yourself. Because I'm afraid to do anything, but once you're in that kind of pain, you have to do whatever it takes.
[00:11:37.440] - Speaker 2
Yes. And it's important to know that after a snake bite, you need to go straight to the hospital, and it's important to know what kind of snake bit you, because there are different antivenoms for different snakes.
[00:11:52.050] - Speaker 1
Yes, of course, for the antilute.
[00:11:53.680] - Speaker 2
And you can take a picture of the snake or you can kill it and take it to the hospital.
[00:11:59.380] - Speaker 1
Yes, it's best to kill it, because you live in the moment and there's no time for anything else. Give it away and see if we can kill it, and take it to the hospital to find out what kind of snake bit it. But you know, you don't know all the snakes, what's an equis snake, an oral snake, that other one. There are so many snakes.
[00:12:20.090] - Speaker 2
But yes, thank you very much for your time. Very kind of you. No, thank you. I'm glad. Thank you very much. All right. Well, thank you.
[00:12:33.540] - Speaker 1
It didn't even bite you. Yes, thank God.
[00:12:37.140] - Speaker 2
Yes. Because it's not your turn.
[00:12:38.970] - Speaker 1
Yes, what isn't meant for you, what isn't good for you. Thank God. Well, Isla Vicente.
