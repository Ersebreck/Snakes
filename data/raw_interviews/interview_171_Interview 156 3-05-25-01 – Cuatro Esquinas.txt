I'm from here, but I used to live in Bogotá and have been living here for five years.
[00:00:25.040] - Speaker 1
And do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here? Yes. Why?
[00:00:32.030] - Speaker 2
Because there are other parts.
[00:00:33.660] - Speaker 1
Yes, of course. And have any of your animals been killed by a snake, such as a pet or livestock?
[00:00:41.720] - Speaker 2
No. It was eaten yesterday. Yesterday it went into my brother-in-law's yard and was eaten. It was eating a chicken. Okay, half of one.
[00:00:55.140] - Speaker 1
Do you know what kind of snake it is?
[00:00:57.240] - Speaker 2
It was half. My husband wasn't half. So, do you know how to prevent or avoid a snake bite before a snake bite? And then, be careful with that Try to wear boots, try to keep the problem from getting there, which is usually by getting used to putting something there so it doesn't get there. Anyway, they say cats get them too.
[00:01:29.970] - Speaker 1
Yes, okay. With the ones they make. Yes. And what would you do if a snake died?
[00:01:38.470] - Speaker 2
I'll call the cubit to explain.
[00:01:44.590] - Speaker 1
And would you go to the hospital in El Carmen or where? To El Carmen, yes.
[00:01:53.870] - Speaker 2
Yes, it's Carmen's turn because she's closer to you.
[00:01:56.940] - Speaker 1
And would you trust the hospital in El Carmen to treat a snake bite?
[00:02:02.160] - Speaker 2
Not much, but the first part, the part closest to the center.
[00:02:06.570] - Speaker 1
Would you trust other hospitals to treat a snake bite?
[00:02:10.590] - Speaker 2
There are better ones, but the first one plays there at my house.
[00:02:16.080] - Speaker 1
And if you need to go to the hospital, is that difficult for you or easy?
[00:02:21.690] - Speaker 2
It's difficult because if my husband is there, we have the motorcycle, but if not, we have to find a car.
[00:02:30.540] - Speaker 1
And where do you feel most likely to be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:02:38.240] - Speaker 2
In the countryside.
[00:02:39.560] - Speaker 1
Why?
[00:02:41.090] - Speaker 2
Because there is a problem: these people almost don't enter the house because of the noise, even though they do enter.
[00:02:47.130] - Speaker 1
And do you know how to tell if a snake is poisonous or non-poisonous?
[00:02:55.490] - Speaker 2
No.
[00:02:56.410] - Speaker 1
It's difficult, yes.
[00:02:57.320] - Speaker 2
Yes, I'm still learning.
[00:02:59.900] - Speaker 1
Yes. And do you know of a case of a snake bite? I'll look at the bite. Sure, yes, the bite. I have no further questions, but do you have anything else to say about snakes, your knowledge of snakes, anything else? No, no, no.
[00:03:19.880] - Speaker 2
No, no, no. No, no, no.
[00:03:21.190] - Speaker 1
Well, it's important to know what to do after a snake bite and your right to go to the hospital. And it's important to know what kind of snake bit you, because there are different antivenoms for different snakes. You can take a picture of the snake or you can kill it and take it to the hospital. But anyway, yes, that's the most important thing. Thank you very much, Luisa. Thank you.
