Interview 157 3-05-25-02 – Cuatro Esquinas
[00:00:01.090] - Speaker 2
And what's your name?
[00:00:03.000] - Speaker 1
Marta Cecilia Avila Rodriguez.
[00:00:05.850] - Speaker 2
And how old are you?
[00:00:08.110] - Speaker 1
59.
[00:00:09.190] - Speaker 2
And what do you do for a living?
[00:00:13.150] - Speaker 1
Well, here at home. I have my little business here at home. I'm a merchant and a housewife at the same time. Two things.
[00:00:21.830] - Speaker 2
Are you married or single?
[00:00:24.280] - Speaker 1
No, not even one free.
[00:00:25.590] - Speaker 2
And do you have children? Yes. And how many years have you lived here, in El Carmen?
[00:00:32.840] - Speaker 1
Even in Carmen, what happened was that I left for a while and then came back again. I studied here, that is, I did my primary education and part of my secondary education. I left, but then I came back again to stay here since 2000. So, I've been living in the same place where I was born and where I am now for 24 years.
[00:00:58.280] - Speaker 2
So, do you think you're likely to get bitten by a snake here?
[00:01:04.400] - Speaker 1
Of course, yes. It's likely, because we keep almost all snakes here. Yes, that's right. The fields, that's logical. All the fields have that privilege of keeping snakes, because they spend their time in the open space of the field. The reality is that yes, they do.
[00:01:23.910] - Speaker 2
And have any of your animals been killed by a snake, such as a pet, livestock, or a chicken?
[00:01:32.610] - Speaker 1
No, you look at that, but No? No.
[00:01:36.410] - Speaker 2
And do you know how to prevent or avoid a snake bite? Before a bite.
[00:01:47.920] - Speaker 1
How can you avoid being bitten? Well, as I said, to avoid being bitten, you have to be very careful that they are not in the Because if you step on them, of course they're going to bite you, if you go near them or something, as we say here, they'll throw a stick at you or something. So, you have to be very careful where you go to prevent them from biting you, because if they don't bite, if you don't step on them or hit them, they won't bite you. Yes, of course. So, I think prevention is to look carefully where you're walking, especially in places that are dark, and be very alert, because the truth is, they hide a lot in the cold, behind bathrooms, in places where they can also take refuge. So, you have to look at all those places, especially in the fields where we live. That's the best prevention, being aware of that.
[00:02:44.900] - Speaker 2
And what would you do if a snake died?
[00:02:48.650] - Speaker 1
Well, immediately the doctor is the best option, wherever that may be, because you don't know what kind it is, even though we've had many opportunities to learn which ones are dangerous and all that. But you always go to the doctor, because you don't know. There are people who don't have strong defenses to withstand anything, even if it's just a bug bite, because three. It's best to go to the doctor; that's the most important thing to do.
[00:03:21.380] - Speaker 2
And would you go to a doctor in Carmen or in another town?
[00:03:25.760] - Speaker 1
No, that's up to us, so to speak, because the truth is, we have to look for a place where they really take good care of those kinds of animals. Because here in Carmen, for example, the serum is What's it called? A serum? A serum? Yes. A serum? Yes. We don't have that? Yes. Then we have to go quickly to where they have it, so they can give us that poison to use to prevent death.
[00:03:54.540] - Speaker 2
Yes, of course. And if you need to go to the hospital, is that difficult for you or is it easy? If you need to go to the hospital, is that easy for you or is it difficult?
[00:04:07.520] - Speaker 1
No, it's easy. Here it's a bit There, as you say, it depends, because we're in a rural area and it depends on the weather. But you have to go out anyway, as best you can. Here, too, there are many times when it's daytime, so you call the fire department and they come too. So we have that privilege here too. But yes, you have to do it. Even if it's difficult, you have to go. The most important thing is to get people to a medical center when they can't get there themselves. Yes, exactly. Yes, ma'am.
[00:04:39.690] - Speaker 2
And where do you feel most likely to be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:04:49.410] - Speaker 1
Well, the truth is, I think it's both, because here in the countryside, where there's so much open space and the houses are, how can I put it, they have gaps, they're not so closed off, and they get everywhere. It's happened to me, snakes have got into my house, into the bathroom. You see, I'm sitting here and it happens to me. And above all, do you know what I've seen that happens a lot? On the public roads. I don't know why, because on the highway, after it gets dark, I think it must be because they hunt, they hunt little frogs, they hunt that kind of frog. So, I think they also scavenge. So, I think public life is always very important to repair. Because I've seen it, why? Because many times when you go out, one day we went to a rosary here, it's customary to say the rosary for people who have died. And on the way there, while we were in one part, about a mile away, we killed more than five.
[00:05:55.410] - Speaker 1
So, I do have a lot of respect for them. Yes, of course. Because they are out there, especially at night. During the day, they are more camouflaged, but I think they go out hunting at night, which is when they are most dangerous.
[00:06:10.930] - Speaker 2
Can you identify whether snakes are poisonous or venomous?
[00:06:17.860] - Speaker 1
We have learned that here, generally speaking, from a very young age, we have always been taught that size X is deadly. The truth is, that animal does have one that runs away and kind of says so. And above all, there are times when we do have those cases, which happen a lot, like in the dark, you step on it and the snake bites you and then it runs away. So, it's inconvenient, I often don't know how to deal with that, because you don't know right away what kind of snake bit you or why it happened. So, I don't know why. I know that the mothers of those snakes are the size X, the coral ones, but there is one coral snake that is not so poisonous and another that is truly poisonous. And the one they call, I don't know what you call it, four-nosed, chili pepper tail, some that are small, I don't know what you call those. Chili pepper tail, yes. Yes, and those are also very dangerous.
[00:07:19.033] - Speaker 1
But the rest here, no, here there are three that you can tell apart, like I said, when they're around, you can characterize them and say, "That's a mean snake, how scary, we have to get out of here."
[00:07:33.110] - Speaker 1
But sometimes you don't take the precaution of checking, and you don't know what animal bit you. And there have been cases. Not in my neighborhood here in Costa Rica, not here, there weren't any around here. Well, there was a lamb that died at the lady's house. She went to take a bath, and where she has the bathroom, the area was dark. And she was bitten by a snake, but she didn't know what kind of snake it was. And I think they gave her the wrong serum, and she swelled up, it spread to all her organs, and she died. Here, yes, for someone else, you remove the animal. So, yes, I think it's very scary in that sense, because I have those animals myself. I have a lot of favorites here, and I tell people: Be very careful, very careful with those animals, because they say that whether they're small or big, it's the same thing, it's all the same surface area. Exactly, yes.
[00:08:29.542] - Speaker 1
Yes, ma'am. That's the truth.
[00:08:34.570] - Speaker 2
Do you know of any other cases of snake bites? Of course, Luzmila, but more cases?
[00:08:41.300] - Speaker 1
Yes, there are more cases here. No, look here, I know someone here, here on the sidewalk in Picó, a man from a long time ago. But honestly, I don't know how that man survived. It was a Ramón Romero, who was a snake, and he was in very bad shape, but he survived. He was touched as a change, but that was many years ago, and he was left with sequelae of Like little things on his body. But he got treatment and he survived, even though everyone thought he wouldn't make it. I also have another one, the man upstairs from the little box. It was also recently, about... Last year, around January, about six months ago. But he knows what he did, because here, as you know, you have to use your own methods, like farmers do. He tied it up. He tied his leg and cut it a little so that the blood would come out. And it was very serious, it lasted almost a month, because it managed to...
[00:09:51.447] - Speaker 1
He got dizzy, it was terrible because they brought him down when he was almost very They gave him an IV and all that, but he survived too, even though it was a X.
[00:10:06.040] - Speaker 1
It was terrible, but I don't know. I think that method always works too. Those are three cases that I know of here.
[00:10:18.140] - Speaker 2
There are many here.
[00:10:19.570] - Speaker 1
Yes, there are many here.
[00:10:21.380] - Speaker 2
Yes, there are many. And when you identify a snake, do you identify snakes by their color, their skin, or their head?
[00:10:33.210] - Speaker 1
No, honestly, I don't refer to them by name. I identify them by their color. For example, you know that the X is a beautiful one because it always has an X all over its body. The coral one, because of its color. And the one I call the chili pepper tail, also because of its color, because they are beautiful, they have a very pretty color. But they are also very brave.
[00:10:57.700] - Speaker 2
Yes, very beautiful.
[00:10:59.860] - Speaker 1
I'm going to tell you a story. We were here and my niece was pregnant. And the girl who just came out, Natalia, was in a car. She was going to put the baby to bed, and I don't know how or why. At one point, she slipped, and the baby didn't go to bed. I don't know what happened, but she slipped, and immediately a snake came out, and it was a boa constrictor. She ran out, probably because, according to my nieces, snakes are afraid of pregnant women. I don't know if that's true, but they say they also run away from her. Okay? Yes.
[00:11:33.260] - Speaker 2
We have a little more time, one more minute. Well, I don't have any more questions, but do you have anything else to say about snakes or your knowledge of snakes or anything else?
[00:11:52.950] - Speaker 1
No, well What can I say? All I'm saying is that we who live here in the countryside really need to be very careful. That's what I always tell the children when I go to school. I say, "Teacher, that's why I often fight for the school to be pruned. There are many times when even here at home, because I think that where it's clean, at least you can see the animals. But the truth is that we have to be very careful with those animals, because the truth is, they are very dangerous. That's the only thing I always tell everyone, but there are people, not including myself, who are really very, I don't know, trusting, irresponsible. For example, children walking around there at this time of day. I'm very afraid, as I tell you. It's terrible. But, as you say, I'm not going to ask them to protect me, because what else can you do? For my part, if I'm with them, I don't let them go in there, day or night, because they could be in those bushes, those children could be out there.
[00:12:54.440] - Speaker 1
So, what I think, what I tell everyone, is to be careful, to be responsible around those animals in the woods. There are many times when you want to say, "Oh, come on, let the bush come." And the woman who was bitten by that snake over there, she was just She was going to cut a piece of banana tree and there it was. It's also a challenge, you can imagine. The truth is... I would like to... Although... What's your name, sir? Your colleague? Carlos. Carlos, Carlos Bravo. He has given us many explanations. He has been very helpful to us. We love him very much here, and he loves us very much, but he comes here a lot where they humiliate him. And we know all that because he has taken a census, going house to house, and he has told us and shown us. He told us this one, he told us this one, not this one, yes. Yes, but anyway, the truth is that it's very difficult for us because they're already used to handling them.
[00:13:54.319] - Speaker 1
Even if it's an animal that doesn't sting, I'm very afraid of them. Just seeing them makes me think: Oh, I feel sick, I'm really afraid of those animals.
[00:14:04.320] - Speaker 1
So, that's all I can say. Caution and responsibility for these animals, especially in rural areas, where this happens most often. And as long as we take that precaution, I think that with animals, you learn to live with them and keep an eye on those dark spaces, as I said, all those places where you see bags, trash, stored items—they get into trouble in those places. So, you have to be there and that's all I have to say. Well, thank you.
[00:14:35.900] - Speaker 2
And it's important to know that after a snake bite, it's important to go to the hospital, but you already know that. And it's important to know what kind of snake bit you. You can take a picture of the snake or you can kill it and take it to the hospital.
[00:14:54.100] - Speaker 1
When you can say it, but as I say, because often you rush out in a hurry, you feel the sting. But the animal also runs away in one leap and into the darkness ahead of you. That's the problem. That's the problem, you don't know where it went. The first thing you do. You start running, because it makes you panic. For example, what a sin, but I say that Sorry, my dad said, "God, what's going to happen to me?" But I think that if an animal bites me today, I'd die more from the shock than from the panic... No, it's like you think, you put yourself in God's hands and think about looking at it. So, the important thing is, because when you manage to catch it, no, because once you catch it, you know what animal it is. But when you don't, like what happened to Doña María, and even though... The thing is, she also let her guard down.
[00:15:43.938] - Speaker 1
I tell people: Look, let's not let our guard down. I can't talk. It's one thing to talk and another to see that the reality is that we have a health center.
[00:15:53.580] - Speaker 1
We can't rely on that for a disaster like that. We have to take matters into our own hands. Both the family member and the person who is going to take the person: Come on, come on, nothing. Even if it means taking everything on a motorcycle, let's take her, but now. We can't just wait around, because that's what I've always said: We can't wait. In these cases, you can't wait with these animals. You can't play around with them. When they bite, you have to act fast, no matter what. And try not to take them to Carmen, because that's just first aid, and we can't have first aid there. We have to get straight to the place where they can really start treating them to prevent their blood from poisoning. So, I think that in this case, our hospital is not competent to deal with negligence like this. And I've told my community, I've said: Be careful with that, be very careful. Even if it's the middle of the night, whatever time it is, don't trust anyone, just go.
[00:16:54.301] - Speaker 1
Go straight to Gilardo.
[00:16:56.820] - Speaker 1
Sort it out there, because they won't stop you there. Or at least there they know how to control it, so that suddenly I don't know, medicine. But yes, that has to be done... Otherwise, you know that among all people there are those who say: "I'll take the noje, what's that? The hielda. The hielda from the borugo tree." But we'll have to see. Well, yes, it's not in God's hands, but anyway, as the Father tells us: God is very great and powerful, but we also have to seek professional help. Because He helps us, but we also have to do our part. But thank God here, well, no, fortunately not, right? Yes. When it bit you, what a scare. But here I am, thank God. But here I am.
[00:17:43.870] - Speaker 2
Yes.
[00:17:45.400] - Speaker 1
No, right now we have to be very careful. Although I told myself: I'm not well, I haven't seen a problem.
[00:17:49.300] - Speaker 2
It is important, yes.
[00:17:50.890] - Speaker 1
They're like Do you know where they hide when they're looking for cool places? Right now in winter, they're out there. On the contrary, when it rains, snakes look for places to hide inside. No, but I think it's the opposite, because they look for damp places. They look for damp places, right? No, on the contrary. You have to be very careful inside, because when it rains a lot, they look inside, in shoes, in corners, in closets. I'm not telling you that one day, the day it happened to us there in the middle of the room and the piece got stuck. You stopped messing around, I took it out. It was a beer can there and you have to see that it got stuck in one of those beers. I mean, it knocked them all over, I don't know, and we couldn't find it. We couldn't find it. That thing about us... No, we didn't sleep together. No, I told him: I mean, I feel bad, but I'm not leaving here.
[00:18:48.376] - Speaker 1
I'm not leaving here until that animal gets out. I was sitting on a chair with my feet up, because when I said, "What's wrong?" and I said, "No."
[00:18:58.160] - Speaker 1
So, I put a chair there while I was standing there when he came out. That's where we managed to kill him. It was a big one, right? Or was it one of the ones from here, the ones with the baskets? Yes, it was a dangerous animal, one of those fierce ones. Usually, I don't allow them to have a tortillo, because the tortillo protects them, because they, like the tortillo, cover the mattress and stay protected underneath, so they can't get to us. We're not in the other house, we're in another one. We were in another one, watching television, when boom, the awning fell on top of us. What a scare, tell me: Holy Mother. Of course, then she was heavy as always, so she was stuck on the awning. She's smooth, so she couldn't get out. Neither could the snake, nor could we get out of the little room. It was chaos. That was a very scary incident, I remember it well.
[00:19:56.785] - Speaker 1
But it wasn't venomous. It was one of those What are they called? You know? Little coffee-colored ones that are... What are they called? Novejuca, because it wasn't green, like a jacket. One of those little coffee-colored ones that don't bite. But it was big and long.
[00:20:15.080] - Speaker 2
When I'm clumsy, oh dear. I didn't see him.
[00:20:19.740] - Speaker 1
No, that was good.
[00:20:21.820] - Speaker 2
Well, thank you very much for your time. You are very knowledgeable. That's great.
