Really?
[00:02:50.210] - Speaker 1
Yes, I was almost bitten by a snake.
[00:02:52.160] - Speaker 2
From a poisonous one?
[00:02:54.060] - Speaker 1
She was poisonous, a size X. She has bitten me several times. She has never bitten me when I was being nice. Once she was coming with a bucket of stones from the ravine and I stepped on the snake and it bit me.
[00:03:14.560] - Speaker 2
That's too bad. But thank goodness you didn't die. No, it stung me. And do you know how to tell if snakes are poisonous or venomous?
[00:03:26.560] - Speaker 1
Here we sometimes say that they are the most poisonous, they always say that the X ones are, but not the others. At least the coral snake, there are many snakes, there is the coral snake, there is the rabayajin, there is the podrido. And can you identify them? No, we can't. No, we just say that the most poisonous is the talla X, that's what they always say. But the others, we don't know.
[00:03:59.390] - Speaker 2
And when do you identify snakes? Do you identify snakes by their color, their skin, their head, or what?
[00:04:09.490] - Speaker 1
We want the color, size X because it has an X on it, right? Yes. The silicone, that's why.
[00:04:16.470] - Speaker 2
And do you know of a case of snake moribund or have you seen more cases?
[00:04:25.790] - Speaker 1
I know someone who has been bitten by a snake.
[00:04:31.270] - Speaker 2
And I don't have any more questions. Do you have anything else to say about snakes or your knowledge or anything else? We don't have any more. Well, thank you very much for your time.
[00:04:47.950] - Speaker 1
