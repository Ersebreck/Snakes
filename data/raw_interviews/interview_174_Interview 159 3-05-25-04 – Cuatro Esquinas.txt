I am 61 years old.
[00:00:13.710] - Speaker 2
And what do you do for a living?
[00:00:15.330] - Speaker 1
I am a plumber specializing in drinking water, here in the same neighborhood, Cuatro Esquina.
[00:00:18.560] - Speaker 2
Are you married or single?
[00:00:21.400] - Speaker 1
I am married.
[00:00:23.100] - Speaker 2

[00:00:24.760] - Speaker 1
Sure, I have two children.
[00:00:26.660] - Speaker 2
And how many years have you lived in El Carmen?
[00:00:30.930] - Speaker 1
I was born and raised here.
[00:00:33.680] - Speaker 2
Do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:37.850] - Speaker 1
Well, here it's true that you can get bitten, because if a snake bites you from far away, how are they going to get you out of there? Because you might get bitten by one of those big animals. There are two kinds of snakes. It can bite you and you're done for, because there are two kinds of snakes. There's one called a lockhead, which looks like a dry leaf. And the other kind, which we call coliamarilla, is the most dangerous one. There are two kinds of coliamarilla, the candado and the other one. And there's another one called podridora, also called coliamarilla, because it's more psychotic. It's also poisonous, but it's already dead, and if you don't go quickly, it rots you. Because that happened to a boy yesterday. Carmen took him to the hospital and they put him on an IV, but they did it wrong and the boy almost lost his leg. Once they got him out, he had to go to Bogotá because they took him to get everything checked out, and it all rotted because it was a pobridora.
[00:01:41.988] - Speaker 1
We call it la zapa.
[00:01:45.690] - Speaker 2
And have any of your animals been killed by a snake? Here, the lady was also bitten by a snake, but thank God she survived. But an animal, like a pet, livestock, a chicken, has an animal been killed? No. No? No. And do you know how to prevent or avoid a snake bite? Before a bite?
[00:02:11.870] - Speaker 1
I once went to see what they call the snake charmers, who also told us that there is a pink variety called Alejandro, that there is no cure for that casadora, that that casadora does not exist here. You can pass by it, it won't affect you, but if it bites you, it is more deadly than the other variety, it is pinkish.
[00:02:31.880] - Speaker 2
But if you know how to avoid it, how to prevent it.
[00:02:36.840] - Speaker 1
Well, of course, what happens is, as they say, if suddenly there's someone nearby, as you say, if Giradot or Tolemaida is playing, they put him on a drip.
[00:02:43.630] - Speaker 2
And there is another alternative that they gave us there when they taught us how to avoid drinking too much liquid or serum so that it wouldn't harm him.
[00:02:53.040] - Speaker 1
Yes.
[00:02:54.220] - Speaker 2
Do you also have methods for preventing snake bites?
[00:03:01.240] - Speaker 1
Make sure it has visibility, not because the cook bit someone. There's no serum for that here, or anything else you can put on it, because you could also get a torniquet.
[00:03:08.690] - Speaker 2
A rat bit it, so you put it here.
[00:03:14.000] - Speaker 1
Turnstile, okay. The paladera is very quiet.
[00:03:17.480] - Speaker 2
And what would you do if a snake bit you?
[00:03:20.820] - Speaker 1
I would have to find a clinic or hospital, because here in Carmen you can't do that, you'd die. Not there. How did it happen? A cut somewhere.
[00:03:31.920] - Speaker 2
Would you go to the doctor in Carmen or in another hospital?
[00:03:34.890] - Speaker 1
Or to Girardot or Tolemaira, which are the two other parts of the city.
[00:03:38.950] - Speaker 2
Why Girardot or Tolemaira?
[00:03:43.360] - Speaker 1
Because Tolemaira is closer.
[00:03:46.950] - Speaker 2
Wouldn't you trust the hospital, in Carmen, to swear on?
[00:03:50.520] - Speaker 1
No, not Carmen, because she's had a lot of cases there. There's a lady who also called her María, and a young cow bit her and killed her. She was small. By the time they took her there, the poison had already spread outside her body.
[00:04:03.670] - Speaker 2
And if you need to go to the hospital, is that difficult for you or easy?
[00:04:11.530] - Speaker 1
Well, here the reality isn't difficult because suddenly they pick you up on a motorcycle, a mototazo, suddenly under a car, and you're gone.
[00:04:18.310] - Speaker 2
And you live in El Carmen?
[00:04:19.570] - Speaker 1
Yes, I came here, but I have a hard time here because I work around here.
[00:04:22.720] - Speaker 2
And where do you feel you are most likely to be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:04:30.130] - Speaker 1
I can too, because there was a girl here who was bitten. Because at this time of year, when it's raining, they look for dry places. You can go out, but you might get bitten anyway, because there are a lot of people around. You can also get bitten here on the road. Or when you go out into the woods.
[00:04:47.410] - Speaker 2
Yes, of course.
[00:04:48.950] - Speaker 1
I found them where I work, on the floor. Big ones. I found some big ones.
[00:04:57.080] - Speaker 2
That's scary. Do you know how to tell if snakes are poisonous or not?
[00:05:02.920] - Speaker 1
That's why I'm telling you, this is what we call the head of a padlock, which is the head like this, that one is very fierce. And there's another one that has a yellow tail, which is also fierce. And this one, the zapa, and the other one is called the coral, which is colorful. And the rest, as we say, are the rabo de aji, which have a spike, but I've never looked at them. And they also say that there's a type that doesn't bite, but I don't know what that one is either. They told us: Bring some of those, people won't touch them.
[00:05:34.200] - Speaker 2
And do you know of a case of snake bruising?
[00:05:38.980] - Speaker 1
Do you see any bites? No, I haven't seen any bites.
[00:05:40.960] - Speaker 2
I have no further questions, but do you have anything else to say about snakes? Anything else to add?
[00:05:48.110] - Speaker 1
No, just because we already talked about the There are also others that we call the sabanera. There is one that is the sabanera, it's like a little monkey, but it doesn't bite, it's the same thing. And the other one we call the little green snake, that one doesn't bite either.
[00:06:03.820] - Speaker 2
That's the same thing. And the other one we call the green Levite.
[00:06:04.210] - Speaker 1
That one hung itself with twigs, but it's not poisonous either, so identify them, that's right, both of them. It's the sabanera, which doesn't have teeth, but has a little corrosque. And the mitado, and the mitabo, the others call some mitabo, others call them that.
[00:06:20.560] - Speaker 2
Yes, okay. And well, it's important to know after a snake bite that it's important to go to the hospital and it's important to know what kind of snake bit you, because there are different antivenoms for different snakes, and you can take a picture of the snake or you can kill it and take it to the hospital. And yes, that's the most important thing to know. And also, tourniquets are not recommended because the blood needs to circulate in the body. And if you apply a tourniquet, you could lose a leg or an arm or something. You could lose the limb, then. Yes, it's not recommended. But yes, thank you very much for your time. Very kind of you. Thank you very much.
