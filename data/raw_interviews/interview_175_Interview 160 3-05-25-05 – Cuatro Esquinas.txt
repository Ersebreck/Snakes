[00:00:35.030] - Speaker 1
And how many years have you lived in Carmen?
[00:00:38.000] - Speaker 2
All my life.
[00:00:39.320] - Speaker 1
Okay. So, do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:45.890] - Speaker 2
Yes, it's likely. But God forbid, because I'm terrified of them, really terrified.
[00:00:50.120] - Speaker 1
Yes? Yes, I understand. And have any of your animals been bitten by a snake, a pet, livestock, a chicken? No. No? Do you know how to prevent or avoid a snake bite?
[00:01:11.490] - Speaker 2
Although I was wrong, because a dog did bite me once, and it was a snake. Really? Yes, a long time ago I had a dog and it was bitten by a snake and died. It died from the snake bite. But that was many years ago.
[00:01:30.500] - Speaker 1
And do you know how to prevent or avoid a snake bite?
[00:01:37.450] - Speaker 2
Well, going to No, how can you prevent it?
[00:01:40.990] - Speaker 1
How can you prevent it? Yes, before a snake bite. Before, prevent it.
[00:01:45.400] - Speaker 2
Prevent. Avoid. Avoid, looking very carefully where you put things, what you do, what you pick up. Paying close attention. Because one night, I saw that the cat was in the bathroom, jumping from side to side, and I said, "The cat, what is she doing in the bathroom?" Then I said, "It must be a frog." So I stood there carefully looking, and there was a snake there, under the trash can, there was a snake. And since I have them, I I see a snake, I get this horrible feeling, I feel... How scary. So I left, I left immediately and called where... And my nephew came and killed it. It was long, it was always long.
[00:02:26.710] - Speaker 1
Do you know what kind of snake it was?
[00:02:28.690] - Speaker 2
An X. An X? Was it an X? How scary! Yes, it was an X. So, the cat helps, because then, another day, when I got up, there was another dead one in the yard. I'm sure she killed it too.
[00:02:44.300] - Speaker 1
Yes, it's important to look carefully.
[00:02:47.510] - Speaker 2
Yes, look carefully where you put something, or what stone you lift, or why. Yes, exactly. That's avoiding. Yes, that's avoiding.
[00:02:56.390] - Speaker 1
And what would you do if a snake bit you? Well, you'd take a photo of it or something so you could take it to the clinic to get the antidote, right?
[00:03:10.980] - Speaker 2
Yes, that's right.
[00:03:13.130] - Speaker 1
And would you go to the hospital in Carmen or somewhere else?
[00:03:18.450] - Speaker 2
Well, I think I would go straight to the clinic, because at the Carmen Hospital, they don't do anything there, they don't do anything for that.
[00:03:29.370] - Speaker 1
Would you go for a spinner or a spine?
[00:03:32.630] - Speaker 2
Turning or spinal, where to? Where they have the antidote. Yes, where they have the antidote. Yes. Yes, why?
[00:03:43.390] - Speaker 1
And if you need to go to the hospital, is that difficult for you or easy?
[00:03:50.200] - Speaker 2
No, but what about the one in Carmen?
[00:03:53.400] - Speaker 1
Yes, or another hospital.
[00:03:55.010] - Speaker 2
Another hospital?
[00:03:56.370] - Speaker 1
Any hospital?
[00:03:59.500] - Speaker 2
Yes, any of those. Whether it's easy or difficult. Well, no, it's not that difficult either. Okay.
[00:04:08.010] - Speaker 1
And where do you feel you are most likely to be bitten by a snake? At home or in the countryside?
[00:04:20.250] - Speaker 2
Well, it's also likely in the house, because they hide in any corner, anywhere. Yes, of course. Yes, exactly.
[00:04:31.540] - Speaker 1
And can you tell poisonous snakes from non-poisonous ones? No.
[00:04:41.080] - Speaker 2
No, it's difficult. I don't know them.
[00:04:44.870] - Speaker 1
Well, do you know of any cases of snake bites?
[00:04:49.450] - Speaker 2
Yes, from my sister.
[00:04:50.820] - Speaker 1
Yes, anything else?
[00:04:54.160] - Speaker 2
Yes, another man, over here, another man was bitten by a snake. Ramón, remember?
[00:05:01.620] - Speaker 1
Well, I don't have any more questions, but do you have anything else to say about snakes or your knowledge of snakes or anything else?
[00:05:11.620] - Speaker 2
I don't know much about snakes, I'm not very familiar with them. No problem. But yes, more or less different like the most The X, for example, the Coral, the ones that are more... The Rattlesnake, which is a very fierce one, right? Yes. But I'm afraid of all of them, all of them, all of them.
[00:05:26.970] - Speaker 1
Yes, of course, I understand. But well, yes, I think you already know a lot, because the most important thing to know is your right to hospital treatment after a snake bite, and it's important to know what kind of snake bit you.
[00:05:50.020] - Speaker 2
The test to see which snake it was.
[00:05:53.210] - Speaker 1
Yes, and you can take a picture or kill it.
[00:05:56.040] - Speaker 2
Because there's a case here of a woman who was bitten. They said it was a snake, that it was a snake, but they gave her the antidote and she was left in a vegetative state. It probably wasn't a snake, it was something else. And so she was left there, and she's still alive. In the village. Yes, she's alive in the village and she stayed there. How sad. They gave her an antidote, something that wasn't for snake bites.
[00:06:31.710] - Speaker 1
Yes, it's important to know if there was a snake or
[00:06:37.990] - Speaker 2
What's her name? Her name is Chava. Chava Godoy is her name. Because they say she was in a banana grove, cutting a dry leaf, and she grabbed it and bit it. They took her to the clinic and gave her an antidote, but others said it was a spider that had bitten her, not a snake. So, in the end, no one knew for sure, but in any case, she has been alive for many years, although she is in a vegetative state.
[00:07:10.870] - Speaker 1
Well, thank you very much, that's all I have. No, thank you very much for your time, you're very kind.
