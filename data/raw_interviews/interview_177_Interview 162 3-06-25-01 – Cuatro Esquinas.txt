[00:00:00.000] - Speaker 2
And what is your name? Adolfo. And do you agree to be recorded and interviewed? Yes, ma'am. How old are you? 53. And what do you do for a living?
[00:00:13.180] - Speaker 1
Yes, you work. I've seen several.
[00:00:16.430] - Speaker 2
Are you married or single?
[00:00:19.030] - Speaker 1
Common-law marriage.
[00:00:21.320] - Speaker 2
Do you have children?
[00:00:23.580] - Speaker 1
That makes two.
[00:00:25.280] - Speaker 2
And how many years have you lived here, in El Carmen?
[00:00:28.620] - Speaker 1
All my life.
[00:00:30.580] - Speaker 2
Do you think it's likely that a snake will bite you here? Yes, Carmen. Why?
[00:00:36.490] - Speaker 1
There are always snakes here, fierce ones.
[00:00:38.710] - Speaker 2
Has any of your animals been bitten by a snake, such as a pet, livestock, guinea pig, or other animal?
[00:00:47.930] - Speaker 1
My dad, about 30 years ago, got bitten by a size X. Your dad? Yeah.
[00:00:52.980] - Speaker 2
But an animal.
[00:00:55.080] - Speaker 1
A size X, yes.
[00:00:56.440] - Speaker 2
No, how?
[00:00:57.440] - Speaker 1
I asked him about animals that had been bitten. Have any been bitten here? Animals, yes. There's also a collector, and they've also caught a viper that way.
[00:01:05.400] - Speaker 2
And your dad died too. What happened?
[00:01:10.580] - Speaker 1
No, they took him to help him and gave him a blood transfusion and encouraged him, they treated him. And they gave him a timeline, like you did everything the old way, all that was like 40 years ago, but I explained that to him first.
[00:01:22.430] - Speaker 2
And he went to the countryside? Yes, here in the countryside. And was it in Natalia? Yes, in the workshop. And do you know how to prevent or avoid a snake bite? And what would you do if a snake bit you?
[00:01:41.750] - Speaker 1
I would go to the doctor immediately.
[00:01:44.640] - Speaker 2
Would you go to Carmen or to the hospital in Carmen?
[00:01:48.250] - Speaker 1
No, not Carmen's. Suddenly, right down my spine.
[00:01:51.030] - Speaker 2
Why Espinal and not Carmen?
[00:01:52.640] - Speaker 1
Because there isn't one for Carmen, I don't think there's a little detail for that. The easiest thing is at the end.
[00:02:00.610] - Speaker 2
And if you need to go to the hospital, is that easy for you or difficult? It's difficult. Why?
[00:02:08.920] - Speaker 1
All because of transportation or something like that, going for the distance.
[00:02:12.610] - Speaker 2
Yes. Let's go too. And where do you feel you're more likely to get bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:02:25.880] - Speaker 1
In the countryside.
[00:02:28.640] - Speaker 2
Why in the countryside?
[00:02:30.290] - Speaker 1
Because that's where there's the most.
[00:02:33.500] - Speaker 2
Do you know how to identify poisonous snakes or venomous snakes?
[00:02:37.550] - Speaker 1
Some, but not all.
[00:02:38.700] - Speaker 2
How do you identify snakes?
[00:02:41.450] - Speaker 1
Once you see one equity, the one that is already known, it is the only one that I can recognize easily. The others are more difficult, those that are negative or positive populations, no.
[00:02:51.940] - Speaker 2
And do you know of any other cases of snake bites? No. No. Well, I don't have any more questions, but do you have anything else to say about snakes, your knowledge of snakes, anything else? No. Well, the most important information is that after a snake bite, it's important to go to the hospital and it's important to know what kind of snake bit you.
[00:03:22.820] - Speaker 1
Julio bit me so he could tell the story himself, right?
[00:03:25.870] - Speaker 2
Exactly, yes. You can take a picture of the snake or you can kill it, take it to the hospital. But yes, that's what's most important, and I don't have anything else to add. Thank you very much for your time.
