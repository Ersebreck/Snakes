The 30 years.
[00:00:23.540] - Speaker 1
So, do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:27.990] - Speaker 2
Yes.
[00:00:28.730] - Speaker 1
Why?
[00:00:29.650] - Speaker 2
Because there's a lot of size here. Size is what matters most here.
[00:00:35.950] - Speaker 1
Yes, okay. And have any of your animals been bitten by a snake, such as a pet or livestock? No. And do you know how to prevent or avoid a snake bite?
[00:00:52.190] - Speaker 2
No.
[00:00:53.440] - Speaker 1
What would you do if you were bitten by a snake?
[00:00:57.160] - Speaker 2
I'm going to see if they can get to the health center faster and identify what kind of snake bit him, because that's probably what he has, what kind of snake bit him.
[00:01:13.520] - Speaker 1
Would you go to the hospital in El Carmen?
[00:01:15.650] - Speaker 2
In El Carmen, which is more than
[00:01:17.240] - Speaker 1
And would you trust the hospital, in Carmen, to cure a bruise caused by being human?
[00:01:22.070] - Speaker 2
No, although here in Carmen, when someone dies, they always call Tolemaila. Why would you trust Tolemaida more? Because the hospitals here are almost useless.
[00:01:37.880] - Speaker 1
And if you need to go to the hospital, is that difficult for you or easy?
[00:01:43.900] - Speaker 2
Difficult.
[00:01:44.890] - Speaker 1
Why?
[00:01:46.100] - Speaker 2
We're on the road, first of all, and transportation here is very
[00:01:53.400] - Speaker 1
Yes, of course. And where do you feel you're most likely to be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:02:04.180] - Speaker 2
I think that precisely here, because of the surrounding area, we always have to fumigate, because we've found them here in the bathroom, or wherever they look for the cold, and so they're mostly in the bathroom. Since in the two. Yes, okay.
[00:02:21.890] - Speaker 1
And do you know how to tell if a snake is poisonous or not?
[00:02:26.940] - Speaker 2
No, I'm the only one I know, she makes me La cascabel y la talla.
[00:02:34.230] - Speaker 1
And how do you identify snakes? By the sound the rattlesnakes make and by the size of the blind spot they have above them, like one of these. Yes. And do you know of any cases of snake bites?
[00:02:53.120] - Speaker 2
Yes, an aunt.
[00:02:54.650] - Speaker 1
What happened?
[00:02:56.950] - Speaker 2
It was about 16 years ago, at my grandmother's house. She was checking on some plants and saw a carving.
[00:03:10.310] - Speaker 1
And she went on the date? Yes. And she got forward.
[00:03:15.600] - Speaker 2
Yes, no, because she was very young, she was a baby. Yes, but she only lived for a few days Count and six years of memory. Okay.
[00:03:26.400] - Speaker 1
But she survived. Yes. Okay, and did he pass by Carmen or somewhere else?
[00:03:37.530] - Speaker 2
Yes, here on the sidewalk.
[00:03:40.790] - Speaker 1
Well, I don't have any more questions, but do you have anything else to say about snakes or your knowledge of snakes or anything else?
[00:03:50.810] - Speaker 2
No, knowledge from snakes. I had an uncle who lived in Marmero, Guayabas. He worked as a fisherman, extracting oil, specifically for a remedy for women in labor. He worked with cascabezas. And the one who didn't Yes.
[00:04:09.980] - Speaker 1
And I think, yes, and I think you know, but it's important after a snake bite to go to the hospital. And it's important to know what kind of snake bit you. You can take a picture or kill it and take it to the hospital. But yes, that's what's most important, to know. But thank you, I don't have any more.
[00:04:37.680] - Speaker 2
Ale, thank you very much. Take care.
