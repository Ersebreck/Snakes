No.

And the most important information is that after a snake bite, it is important to go straight to the hospital, but you already know that. And it is important to know what kind of snake bit you, because there are different antivenoms for different snakes. You can take a picture of the snake or you can kill it and take it to the hospital.
[00:05:03.430] - Speaker 2
But at the moment, if you don't have one, why take the photo? Yes, it's difficult. Why kill her and take her to one? Yes. What do you do? Yes. I mean, they're going to ask you if you have hemophilia.
