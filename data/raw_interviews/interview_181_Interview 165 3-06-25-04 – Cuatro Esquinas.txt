[00:00:03.020] - Speaker 2
And what's your name?
[00:00:04.940] - Speaker 1
My name is Andrea Diaz.
[00:00:07.330] - Speaker 2
And how old are you?
[00:00:09.630] - Speaker 1
I am 36 years old.
[00:00:11.570] - Speaker 2
What do you do for a living?
[00:00:13.260] - Speaker 1
I am a business administrator and condominium manager.
[00:00:18.860] - Speaker 2
Are you married or single? Married.
[00:00:22.390] - Speaker 3
Do you have children?
[00:00:24.270] - Speaker 2
Yes, ma'am. I have two children. And how many years have you lived here in El Carmen?
[00:00:30.530] - Speaker 1
Here, in Carmen, my whole life.
[00:00:33.520] - Speaker 3
And do you think it's likely that a snake will bite you here?
[00:00:39.990] - Speaker 1
Yes, of course. Why? Because of where we live, because we are in a rural area, so not all the roads are lit, there are a lot of pastures. You're driving home and you come across animals crossing the road, because it's dark and there are areas that are very dark. So, if I'm going to my mother's house, it's dark, so there might be an animal on the road. Yes, of course. Aha, yes, sir.
[00:01:19.740] - Speaker 2
And have any of your animals been killed by a snake, such as a pet, livestock, or a chicken?
[00:01:26.810] - Speaker 1
No, cats. I have six cats, and they do bring snakes into the house. Sure, yes. So sometimes they bring them in dead or half dead and leave them around, but obviously we have to deal with it for safety reasons. But as for being bitten, no, we haven't seen any dogs or cats being bitten.
[00:01:49.570] - Speaker 2
And do you know how to prevent or avoid a snake bite?
[00:01:54.750] - Speaker 1
Well, generally speaking, at least those of us who have gardens, if you notice, we try not to leave too many things lying around under the bushes. We always go out with a flashlight, sometimes we wear boots, although that doesn't prevent it, but yes, we avoid going out in flip-flops or sandals as much as possible. What else do we do? And then we fumigate, it's like pest control, you spray around the Those are the most basic things you do, yes.
[00:02:32.970] - Speaker 3
And what would you do if a snake died?
[00:02:42.020] - Speaker 1
They say, according to what they recommend or have told us. It's like identifying what kind of snake it is, staying calm, although that's not very easy, right? It's not very easy, no. And knowing what kind it really is, as they explained to us, and going to the nearest medical center.
[00:03:07.800] - Speaker 2
Yes, exactly. Would you go to the hospital in Carmen? No. Okay, why not?
[00:03:15.990] - Speaker 1
Well, because they don't have the necessary care, since they don't have good care at all. So, I think I would go directly to the city of Girardot, even if it meant taking many risks, but I wouldn't come here to Carmen for primary or secondary care or anything else.
[00:03:42.030] - Speaker 2
And if you need to, is going to the hospital difficult or easy for you?
[00:03:48.120] - Speaker 1
Well, thank God we have our own vehicles. We have motorcycles, or we can contact someone with a vehicle to get around. Yes, good.
[00:04:00.310] - Speaker 2
So where do you feel you are most likely to be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:04:10.930] - Speaker 1
Well, it's so relative because we're surrounded by so much nature. So, it could be from the plants on the road, or in all areas, you'd be at risk.
[00:04:29.390] - Speaker 2
And do you know how to identify poisonous snakes?
[00:04:34.520] - Speaker 1
Well, when I was young, I worked at a zoo. What did I do? I worked at a subsidized zoo called Pisi Lago, and they had a snake enclosure. The people in charge taught us that there are certain boas that aren't poisonous, how to identify coral snakes by their colors, what other snakes there are Rattlesnakes, obviously, that their heads are triangular, that there are others that are oval. When I also worked at another place, there was a snake investigation at Hyundai, and I had contact with the guys who were snake specialists, and they told us how they caught them and analyzed them and taught us how it's done. But you know that at some point one of them is going to scare you, right? But you try to...
[00:05:35.130] - Speaker 2
Yes, well. And do you know of a case of snake morelora?
[00:05:42.140] - Speaker 1
People have told me in Carmen, also on the side where I sometimes go to get my nails done, that the man across the street also lost part of his leg to a snake bite. Yes, Javier. Next to the library in the village, there was a man who was also bitten by a snake and was seriously ill for a long time. Mrs. María de Porajano Villos, she died, right? Yes, she did die. Well, she didn't pay much attention to it and she passed away, she also died. Yes, and here I think the one over there, like Don Ramón, who was also bitten by a snake. That's the most unusual case I know of.
[00:06:29.260] - Speaker 2
Yes, it's very Well, I don't have any more questions, but do you have anything else to say about snakes or your knowledge of snakes or anything else?
[00:06:39.450] - Speaker 1
No, no, it would be like
[00:06:41.470] - Speaker 2
Perfect. And yes, I think you already know a lot, but it's important to know. After a snake bite, you need to go straight to the hospital. And yes, it's important to know what kind of snake bit you. You can take a picture, you can kill it and take it to the hospital. And tourniquets are not recommended either, because the blood needs to circulate in the body. You can ask for an arm or a leg, seven. That's important to know too. But yeah, I don't have anything else. Thank you very much.
[00:07:22.780] - Speaker 1
Thank you very much for visiting.
[00:07:24.700] - Speaker 2
Yes, you know a lot about snakes, I think.
