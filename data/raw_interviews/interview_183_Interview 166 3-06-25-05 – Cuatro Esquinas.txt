[00:01:00.490] - Speaker 3
And how many years have you been living here, in the park?
[00:01:05.110] - Speaker 2
Well, my whole life, actually. My family is from here, and we live here in the village.
[00:01:11.300] - Speaker 3
Do you have children? One. Do you think it's likely that you'll be bitten by a snake here?
[00:01:24.770] - Speaker 2
Is there a chance they'll bite us? Sure.
[00:01:27.810] - Speaker 3
Why?
[00:01:29.080] - Speaker 2
At all times, because there is a lot of vegetation or a lot of mountains that we are already going to encounter.
[00:01:35.540] - Speaker 1
Yes, you can find them.
[00:01:36.750] - Speaker 2
Sometimes not even in the woods, but in the house itself, because they come here to the house.
[00:01:44.770] - Speaker 3
Sure, yes. And have any of your animals been killed by a snake, such as a pet, livestock, or a chicken?
[00:01:54.560] - Speaker 2
Well, animals, honestly, not that I can remember. No, no, no. No, no, no. But no, not at all. But in the end, no one found out. No, animals, honestly, no.
[00:02:01.840] - Speaker 1
But in the end, no one knew that
[00:02:03.190] - Speaker 2
No, no, not real animals. Relatives, yes.
[00:02:07.770] - Speaker 3
Yes, okay. And what happened? Do you know of any cases of snake bites?
[00:02:15.470] - Speaker 2
Yes, who was calling you? My aunt, your wife.
[00:02:18.430] - Speaker 3
And more people, of course.
[00:02:24.540] - Speaker 2
There have been several in the area. Over there, there's a trail called, I think, Peñón Blanco, something like that, Novillo. There have been two or three cases there, I think. Also in Yes, because Marlo, a friend of mine, was nearby, here by the entrance called San Isidro. He was going camping one night and when he got there, he came running because he had been bitten by a snake.
[00:02:55.680] - Speaker 3
There are many cases here.
[00:02:57.840] - Speaker 2
Yes, there are many cases.
[00:03:00.450] - Speaker 3
And do you know how to prevent or avoid a snake bite?
[00:03:07.190] - Speaker 1
No, no, no, no. Not there, no. Well, you avoid it by, let's say, running, killing the ovaries, right?
[00:03:13.590] - Speaker 2
Yes, because if you manage to see it, at that moment, you don't kill it. No. It's like the instinct around here, that once it touches you, you have to kill it. And then you run and call for help, so they can take you to the nearest hospital. And not even the nearest one, because here in this town there's no antidote or anything, if it touches your spine.
[00:03:41.120] - Speaker 3
Would you go to the hospital in Carmen or would you go to the spine clinic if you had a snake bite?
[00:03:47.920] - Speaker 2
To be honest, I wouldn't even go to the Carmen hospital, because you know they won't do anything there. That's for someone with a spinal injury, I'd give it to them.
[00:03:58.620] - Speaker 3
And before a snake bite, do you have any methods of prevention? Prevention of snake bites?
[00:04:08.260] - Speaker 2
No, not really, because there's already one person who's scared. Yes, of course.
[00:04:12.970] - Speaker 3
And if you need to go to the hospital, is it difficult or easy to get to the hospital from here?
[00:04:24.100] - Speaker 1
It's difficult because you have to find a motorcycle taxi, and if you can't, that's a problem. Of course. And if there's no public transportation and the motorcycle is in El Carmen, then it's really difficult. Or someone who, when they take you to the emergency room, some neighbor, gets annoyed.
[00:04:43.420] - Speaker 3
Yes, okay. And where do you feel most likely to be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:04:55.490] - Speaker 2
Usually, whenever you go into, say, the woods or come out, where it's all overgrown, you think it's more likely to bite you there. But usually, as I said, they're in the house, or you come out and the snake is already there. But it's more likely to happen where there's grass and woods.
[00:05:25.150] - Speaker 3
And do you know how to identify poisonous snakes?
[00:05:30.420] - Speaker 2
More or less.
[00:05:31.830] - Speaker 3
How did you identify the snake?
[00:05:34.200] - Speaker 2
More or less, because, for example, there are fake ones. According to what the other colleagues who have been here have taught us, they told me that there are fake ones and that there is one But it's very difficult, you don't really know, because it could be a fake one and you realize it, mostly because suddenly you open its mouth with something, and if it has fangs, then yes, it's poisonous. And if it's fake, they have a little ring, like in the mouth. But after you bite it, you know if it's poisonous or not. Yes, of course. By the colors, but it's difficult. It's difficult. It's difficult, it's very difficult. You have to remember it very well. For example, the forales, right? Uh-huh. They have... There's a fake one and a real one. Yes, I don't know if the fake one is the one with the ring in the middle of the white color, is that the fake one or the real one?
[00:06:38.780] - Speaker 3
I believe, I'm no expert on snakes, but I believe the true ones have black scales. How do you say that? They have red, black, and white. Red, black, and white. And inside, the red markings. If it's a real one, the black ones are inside, the red ones are either one, three, or five, not two or four, if you know what I mean. I don't know the word for it, but that's right. And the markings on real ones need to cover the whole body. If they're only on top, it's a fake, if you know what I mean.
[00:07:33.160] - Speaker 2
Yes, it's difficult.
[00:07:35.930] - Speaker 3
It's difficult, especially at the moment.
[00:07:38.750] - Speaker 2
The first thing you see, suddenly, whether it's a snake or a serpent, you kill it. Right away.
[00:07:45.300] - Speaker 1
And you're afraid of all of them. They say the green ones don't do anything, but I'll knock them down. I'm really afraid of them.
[00:07:54.080] - Speaker 2
And you almost always kill them, and after they're dead, you can look at them with, like, a stick, to see if they were poisonous or fake. Yes, exactly. That's pretty much all we do around here. It's difficult, yes. You shouldn't kill tortillas, right?
[00:08:13.150] - Speaker 3
Yes. But Yes, and yes, I don't have any more questions, but do you have anything else to say about snakes or your knowledge of snakes or anything else? No, ma'am.
[00:08:28.830] - Speaker 1
All I know is that I'm afraid of all of them, I shoot to kill them all.
[00:08:34.980] - Speaker 3
Yes, it is important after a snake bite to go straight to the hospital and it is important to know what kind of snake bit you, but it is difficult.
[00:08:47.950] - Speaker 1
Exactly, yes.
[00:08:49.270] - Speaker 3
But you can take a picture of the snake or you can kill it and take it to the hospital. What about my mom? Because there are different antivenoms for different snakes. And yes, that's the most important thing to know after a snake bite. For prevention, snakes like to hide in trash or things around the house. You need to clean the house very well. And wear boots in the countryside and take a flashlight at night. Those are important methods for prevention. But yes, I don't have any more. Thank you very much for your time. Very kind of you.
[00:09:48.030] - Speaker 1
Thank you.
