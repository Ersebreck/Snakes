Do you have children?

And how many years have you lived in El Carmen?
[00:00:44.790] - Speaker 2
No, one month.
[00:00:46.390] - Speaker 1
Only a month. Okay, fine. And do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:53.920] - Speaker 2
No.
[00:00:55.430] - Speaker 1
Why?
[00:00:56.500] - Speaker 2
I haven't found the first one.
[00:00:58.210] - Speaker 1
And no, I haven't seen the first one. Have any of your animals been bitten by a snake, like livestock?
[00:01:06.570] - Speaker 2
No, no workers, nothing.
[00:01:11.290] - Speaker 1
And do you know how to prevent or avoid a snake bite?
[00:01:18.880] - Speaker 2
Well, don't go up to her and give her one, or flirt with her or anything. If you see them, just leave them alone and keep going.
[00:01:27.190] - Speaker 1
And what would you do if a snake bit you?
[00:01:33.290] - Speaker 2
Well, they say that if you hook up with someone, hook up with a comb or a knife or a pocketknife. For example, she bites me here, and you take the comb and the back of it and do this, carve it well so the poison doesn't spread. I listened to the old folks.
[00:01:55.680] - Speaker 1
Would you go to the hospital too?
[00:01:59.330] - Speaker 2
Yes, of course, that's better. The anti-hygienic serum is the real one.
[00:02:05.220] - Speaker 1
And would you go to the hospital in Carmen or somewhere else?
[00:02:09.660] - Speaker 2
Yes, the closest place where one can go.
[00:02:14.450] - Speaker 1
And would you trust the hospital in Carmen to treat a snake bite?
[00:02:19.850] - Speaker 2
I believe so, yes.
[00:02:23.260] - Speaker 1
And would you trust other hospitals to treat a snake bite?
[00:02:28.920] - Speaker 2
Yes, usually all hospitals keep antibiotic serum on hand.
[00:02:33.720] - Speaker 1
And if you need to go to the hospital, is that difficult for you or easy?
[00:02:43.800] - Speaker 2
I think some people ride motorcycles or some people take them out.
[00:02:50.810] - Speaker 1
And where do you feel most likely to be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:02:59.520] - Speaker 2
And in the countryside.
[00:03:00.650] - Speaker 1
In the countryside. Why in the countryside?
[00:03:03.870] - Speaker 2
Well, because you're out there in the woods and all that. For example, today I had to go down the side of a ravine, all wet, running, to work, and sometimes I didn't make it up the pipe, and I'm running through the woods, and there can be rocks like that. Because at home, I don't think so, you sweep and mop and all that and you see them.
[00:03:30.570] - Speaker 1
Do you know how to identify poisonous or venomous snakes? Yes, of course. How do you identify snakes?
[00:03:38.870] - Speaker 2
Like Eki, Cascabel, Mapaná, Coral, Rabo de Ají, and 24. All my life has been spent in the countryside, in the mountains.
[00:03:51.150] - Speaker 1
And how do you identify snakes? By their corolla, their skin, their head? How do you identify them?
[00:03:58.070] - Speaker 2
Like always, you see them differently your whole life. For example, I'll go out and find a snake and say, "It's a size X." Or it's a rattlesnake. The rattlesnake is very similar to size X because it already has the X's, but it's lighter in color. Size X, on the other hand, has the X's, but the color is more brown, darker.
[00:04:27.810] - Speaker 1
And do you know of a case of snake helping humans?
[00:04:33.240] - Speaker 2
No, Mom. No? Okay, fine. I was very young when my sister at home bit one behind the bed, a size X, but it was so small.
[00:04:44.030] - Speaker 1
And she went? And she wasn't going to the hospital?
[00:04:45.960] - Speaker 2
No, there were some black guys there, the late Modesto, and he cured her, he bit her on the mouth. She was cleaning the house and saw something black and thought it was a string or a cord and reached out her hand and grabbed it and I grabbed it. He bit her.
[00:05:05.770] - Speaker 1
Well, I don't have any more questions, but do you have anything else to say about snakes or your knowledge of snakes or anything else?
[00:05:14.920] - Speaker 2
I know a lot about snakes, such as the mitado, the derrugoso, and the pudridora. I know a lot about snakes. The coral snake, the matagana, or the coral snake, which is black-headed. Red with white, but it's black-headed. And the chili tail is red, but it has black rings. One red ring, one black ring. That's the chili tail, which is very dangerous.
[00:05:50.720] - Speaker 1
Well, it's important to know after a snake bite, do you need to go to the hospital? Yes, my love, of course. And it's important to know what kind of snake bit you, because there are different antivenoms for different snakes. You can take a picture of the snake or you can kill it and take it to the hospital. But that's the most important thing to know. And well, that's all I have. Thank you very much for your time. Very kind of you.
