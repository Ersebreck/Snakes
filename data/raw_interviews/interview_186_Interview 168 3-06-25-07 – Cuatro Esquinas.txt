[00:00:00.000] - Speaker 2
And what's your name?
[00:00:02.670] - Speaker 1
My name is Johan.
[00:00:04.510] - Speaker 2
And how old are you? Eighteen. And what do you do for a living?
[00:00:10.460] - Speaker 1
For now, they help me here at home with my homework, whatever I have to do.
[00:00:16.860] - Speaker 2
Are you married or single? No, single. And how long have you lived here in El Carmen?
[00:00:25.610] - Speaker 1
No, for the moment, I'll be here for a month too.
[00:00:29.380] - Speaker 2
And do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:34.910] - Speaker 1
Well, in theory, it's 100%, maybe 80%, 90%.
[00:00:39.850] - Speaker 2
Why?
[00:00:41.830] - Speaker 1
Because it's the countryside and she likes it. She always likes walking here where there are trees and everything.
[00:00:50.470] - Speaker 2
And have any of your animals been killed by a snake, such as livestock, a chicken, or a pet?
[00:00:59.470] - Speaker 1
No, not while I was in the hospital.
[00:01:03.680] - Speaker 2
And do you know how they prevented or avoided a snake bite?
[00:01:07.200] - Speaker 1
No, honestly, I don't know how The most common thing would be to go to the hospital and get help, because what would you do if a snake bit you? Like I said, I would ask my parents for help and they would take me to the hospital to get treatment.
[00:01:30.680] - Speaker 2
Would you go to the hospital in Carmen or somewhere else?
[00:01:35.110] - Speaker 1
It depends on the situation. For example, if it's poisonous and the bridge is severely damaged, then Melgar would be better.
[00:01:45.450] - Speaker 2
And why Melgar and not Carmen?
[00:01:49.180] - Speaker 1
I think that the service is better in Melgar than here in Carmen.
[00:01:59.010] - Speaker 2
And if you need to go to the hospital, is that difficult for you or easy?
[00:02:06.720] - Speaker 1
I thought it would be easy, yes, because I know a lot of people around here and they could help me out, take me there in a minute.
[00:02:14.820] - Speaker 2
And where do you feel you are most likely to be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:02:24.350] - Speaker 1
I think in the countryside, because the countryside is where they live.
[00:02:30.750] - Speaker 2
And do you know how to identify poisonous snakes?
[00:02:38.660] - Speaker 1
I kind of know, for example, cobras and rattlesnakes are the ones I know best.
[00:02:46.190] - Speaker 2
And how do you identify snakes? By their color, their skin, or perhaps something else?
[00:02:50.930] - Speaker 1
Yes, because of the color of his skin, you could say.
[00:02:53.590] - Speaker 2
And do you know of a case of snake wood?
[00:03:00.280] - Speaker 1
No, not at the moment.
[00:03:04.730] - Speaker 2
I have no further questions, but do you have anything else to say about snakes or your knowledge of snakes or anything else?
[00:03:12.830] - Speaker 1
No, I think that's fine, yes.
[00:03:15.310] - Speaker 2
And yes, it's important to know that after a snake bite, you need to go straight to the hospital, and it's important to know what kind of snake bit you, because there are different antivenoms for different snakes. You can take a picture of the snake or you can kill it and take it to the hospital. But that's the most important thing to know. And yes, that's all I have. Thank you very much for your time. You're very kind. Thank you.
