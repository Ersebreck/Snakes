[00:00:22.480] - Speaker 1
And how many years have you lived in Carmen?
[00:00:25.570] - Speaker 2
In Carmen de Apicalá, I've lived my whole life in the village.
[00:00:31.310] - Speaker 1
And do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:36.950] - Speaker 2
Yes, it's likely, because I often encounter snakes.
[00:00:43.780] - Speaker 1
And any animals? And in the end, have you ever been bitten by a snake, like a pet, livestock, or a chicken?
[00:00:51.150] - Speaker 2
No, ma'am, not so far.
[00:00:54.870] - Speaker 1
And do you know how to prevent or avoid a snake bite? Suddenly, I shouldn't bother it because they get angry, some of them leave.
[00:01:10.020] - Speaker 2
Usually, we get a stick and kill them or use a comb. When we see that they are angry.
[00:01:23.960] - Speaker 1
And what would you do if a snake bit you?
[00:01:29.420] - Speaker 2
If I am bitten by a snake, I will ask for help and go to the nearest place where I can receive first aid or where someone knows how to treat the bite.
[00:01:47.900] - Speaker 1
And would you go to the hospital in Carmen?
[00:01:52.280] - Speaker 2
I don't think so, because our EPS is in Girardot and we would go directly to Girardot.
[00:02:03.480] - Speaker 1
And wouldn't you trust the hospital, in Carmen?
[00:02:07.600] - Speaker 2
I don't trust the hospital, no. Why? Because recently, as I suffer from a heart condition called cardiac arrhythmia, which I get often. And recently I had an episode in town and they took me there and were going to resuscitate me, but they didn't even know how to use the equipment to take an electrocardiogram; they were putting it on wrong. So, if they can't even put it on right, how long will it take to get someone with a snake bite out of there? You can't see it.
[00:02:49.000] - Speaker 1
And if you need to go to the hospital, is that difficult for you or easy?
[00:02:57.700] - Speaker 2
Why do I need to go to the village?
[00:03:02.360] - Speaker 1
If you have a snake bite, for example, and it's an emergency and you need to go to the hospital, is it difficult or easy to get there?
[00:03:16.640] - Speaker 2
Do you have transportation? Well, while I get to the hospital and they arrange for a transfer, I'll go directly to my EPS in Girardot. The longer they keep me there in that hospital doing a Nothing, because what can they give me there?
[00:03:35.910] - Speaker 1
But do you always have transportation from here to the hospital or not?
[00:03:45.670] - Speaker 2
Well, no, that's why I'm telling you, I would ask someone close to me who could drive me or take me quickly to the hospital.
[00:03:58.670] - Speaker 1
And where do you feel most likely to be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:04:07.890] - Speaker 2
Both sides need to be on guard, because I already told you: What day do cats kill? They killed one here and then another one there where we were, and I showed Antonio, who was right there. Then, in that Almost overnight, they killed two. And they're fierce because they were X, right? Yes. So, you have to be careful and keep spraying. I've done that sulfur thing, I've done it over there on the bushes. So, you always have to be careful.
[00:04:52.240] - Speaker 1
And do you know how to identify poisonous snakes?
[00:05:01.000] - Speaker 2
I was taught, as I have lived in the countryside all my life, that you have to be careful, whether it's one or the other, because I was very trusting with those green plants, what are they called? Bejuca. Bejuca. And one day I had a cat and it got all tangled up in it, and the cat was drowning. The cat could hardly breathe, and after about three days, the cat died. I don't know what that snake did to it. So, I was trusting with it, I even scared it away. But from that day on, I said, "When I see it again, I'll kill it, because that's the one that killed the cat." I don't know if it left, if it bit it, or what. But it took a while to die, and after about three days, it died somewhere.
[00:05:55.000] - Speaker 1
And do you know of any cases of snake bites?
[00:06:01.930] - Speaker 2
Well, right nearby, a man who has since moved away from the neighboring street was bitten by a X. He used to come here to the store often and tell us everything that happened to him. And even with those long boots, he was wearing them the day the snake bit him. So even those boots don't protect you from a bite. He was saved because they took him to the hospital quickly. Mrs. Luzmila was also bitten by a snake. Of course. There were other people who also took too long to go, like Mrs. María, who went to the hospital when it was already too late. So she died. Yes. You have to go as quickly as possible to get help.
[00:07:05.520] - Speaker 1
Yes, it's important. I don't have any more questions, but do you have anything else to say about snakes or your knowledge of snakes or anything else?
[00:07:22.470] - Speaker 2
No, I know snakes are dangerous. When I was a child, we grew up on a farm in the mountains, where my father had a ranch. Once there was a very large snake, and he shot it and split it in half, but the other half kept chasing him. It was huge, shaped like an X. And he always told us to be careful, but there were 11 of us kids growing up on that farm, and we were always careful, because how can you know that one isn't going to bite you? So, you always have to be wary of touching them or messing with them, as we say. That's what it means to be careful.
[00:08:24.840] - Speaker 1
Yes, it's important. And it's important to look at a snake bite afterwards, it's important to go straight to the hospital, and it's important to know what kind of snake bit you, because there are different antivenoms for different snakes. And you can take a picture of the snake or you can kill it and take it to the hospital. But that's the most important thing to know after a snake bite. But I think you already know a lot about snakes. Yes. But thank you very much, I don't have any more questions.
[00:09:02.830] - Speaker 2
No, ma'am, at your service.
[00:09:03.700] - Speaker 1
Very kind. Thank you very much.
[00:09:06.740] - Speaker 2
All done.
