A girl.
[00:00:27.320] - Speaker 2
And how many years have you lived here? In El Carmen?
[00:00:31.040] - Speaker 1
All my life.
[00:00:32.230] - Speaker 2
Okay, well. So, do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:41.860] - Speaker 1
Sure. Why? Well, because here, I mean, the mountains are very close, I mean, towards us. So, one could come out at any time. And since you walk around there at night, it's more likely that You always take precautions, you're careful, you take a flashlight with you and stuff, but you never know when you might not see it or something.
[00:01:18.230] - Speaker 2
Has any of your animals been bitten by a snake, such as a pet, livestock, or a chicken?
[00:01:27.860] - Speaker 1
Well, sometimes I haven't seen any cases, but in others Let's say, on farms, cows bite. But at that moment, let's say, not us, we've never been bitten like that, not even by a little dog.
[00:01:49.720] - Speaker 2
And do you know how to prevent or avoid a snake bite?
[00:01:55.210] - Speaker 1
How can this be avoided? By not biting it?
[00:01:59.600] - Speaker 2
Yes.
[00:02:00.870] - Speaker 1
Well, I don't know.
[00:02:03.080] - Speaker 2
It's difficult, yes, it's difficult.
[00:02:05.800] - Speaker 1
That's really difficult, because sometimes snakes even come into the house. At least I have a kitten, and it brings snakes into the house. When it brings them, they seem to be asleep. So, I kill them right away, because every snake I see, even if people say it's not poisonous, I kill it. I kill it right away, because you never know, you don't know, because everyone says The size, well, it's dangerous, it's the most dangerous one, but to me they're all dangerous. They're all real.
[00:02:56.890] - Speaker 2
Yes, of course. They're all real. And what would you do if a snake bit you?
[00:03:05.370] - Speaker 1
First, I'm going to the hospital.
[00:03:07.350] - Speaker 2
And in this case, there are many times when they say that where it bites, you should make a little twist where it bites and go to the doctor, because what else can we do here?
[00:03:24.480] - Speaker 1
You know what might happen or what.
[00:03:30.010] - Speaker 2
And would you go to the hospital in Carmen?
[00:03:33.300] - Speaker 1
Well, it's the fastest way, yes. But we shouldn't do that, because it's not a clinic, it's a low-level hospital. I mean, it's not What they do is send you straight to another place, because I don't think they can guarantee anything there either.
[00:03:57.850] - Speaker 2
Would you trust other hospitals to treat a snake bite? Yes. Which ones?
[00:04:03.430] - Speaker 1
Let's say the clinics in Girardot are very good.
[00:04:09.880] - Speaker 2
And if you need to go to the hospital, is it difficult for you or is it easy from here?
[00:04:17.200] - Speaker 1
From here to the hospital, it can be difficult sometimes. Because you can't find a car right away. Sometimes, let's say, the motorcycle taxis aren't around because they leave early in the morning. You have to call one to come pick you up.
[00:04:41.700] - Speaker 2
And where do you feel you are most likely to be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:04:49.510] - Speaker 1
In the countryside.
[00:04:50.840] - Speaker 2
Why?
[00:04:52.230] - Speaker 1
Well, because, let's say, you go out, at least in the countryside, where there's only vegetation, and it's very likely that at some point there will be a snake where you might step, you know what I mean?
[00:05:07.040] - Speaker 2
Yes. And can you tell if snakes are poisonous or venomous?
[00:05:15.160] - Speaker 1
Well, at least sometimes, the size they say, how come they're called Cascabel? They're poisonous, they're fierce.
[00:05:36.210] - Speaker 2
Yes.
[00:05:37.330] - Speaker 1
Those are the ones I know of around here. There may be more, but I don't know their names.
[00:05:45.420] - Speaker 2
And, for example, how do you identify a size?
[00:05:49.620] - Speaker 1
Because she has it on her body, she has the X, which means she has X. You can identify her, that one.
[00:06:00.120] - Speaker 2
It's very difficult, yes. And do you know of a case of snake morelora?
[00:06:07.780] - Speaker 1
A case? Yes.
[00:06:10.630] - Speaker 2
And what happened in that case?
[00:06:13.700] - Speaker 1
How did it happen? Well, there was a boy, not so young anymore, who was sent to the store to run an errand. He went with my little nephew. And here, going up, up here, they were walking like this. And no Well, the boy felt something bite him, but he didn't pay any attention to it. He didn't pay any attention to it. He got to the store and there it started to hurt, it started to hurt. Then the man at the store told him that it looked like a culagos bite. So they came quickly and from here we had to send them to... I mean, they took him to the hospital.
[00:06:59.470] - Speaker 2
And, well, I don't have any more questions, but do you have anything else to say about snakes or your knowledge of snakes or anything else? No. No? No. Okay, yes. And the most important information is that after a snake bite, it's important to go straight to the hospital. And it's important to know what kind of snake bit you, because there are different antivenoms for different snakes.
[00:07:29.060] - Speaker 1
Yes, because no one knew what had happened to the child, because they didn't realize that They asked them there, when they took him, what kind of snake it was, right? How were we supposed to know what kind of snake it was? No one knew anything. Anyway, he was taken to the hospital, and there they didn't want to find the old one that had bitten him.
[00:07:48.630] - Speaker 2
Yes. And you can take a photo of the snake or you can kill it and take it to the hospital. To the hospital, yes. And tourniquets are not recommended for deadly snakes, because the blood needs to circulate in the body. Hello, good afternoon.
[00:08:15.410] - Speaker 1
We're fine.
[00:08:16.790] - Speaker 2
And yes, that's the most important thing to know. But thank you very much for your time. Very kind of you.
