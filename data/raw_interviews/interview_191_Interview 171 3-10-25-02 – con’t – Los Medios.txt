In bed? A snake got into my bed. You found one in your bed? No, I got there and went to bed. I got it out of bed and went to bed. I don't know how that snake got in there. I don't know where. I'm going to get a bull, but I don't know how. But it was a snake like that. I was asleep when the snake passed me. When it happened, I felt something cold. But I said, "What is this?" Then, since I keep a flashlight on my bed, I grabbed it and shone it on the snake. And what happened? When I saw the snake jumping around, I said, "I'm getting out of here!" I asked him, "What should I do? Should I scream?" I called my husband and told him, "A snake, a brown one. But it didn't bite me. Okay. Yes, it didn't bite me. How scary. Then my husband lifted everything up and pulled it out and killed it.
[00:00:50.830] - Speaker 1
But it didn't sting. Yes, that's right. But it was only for a moment
[00:00:56.770] - Speaker 2
Thank God. But I felt cold, like that bitch was passing by me, that's what happened. But I was kind of nervous. But that was a long time ago. A long time ago. A long time ago, yes. That's good. And she said thank God that animal didn't bite me. And it was a fierce one, because they said it was a desarroja, coral, coral. Seriously. Desarroja.
[00:01:20.850] - Speaker 1
Which one is it? Yeah, she's a bitch. That's a better way to put it. And you guys go to the hospital, because I'm not
[00:01:26.400] - Speaker 3
No, there.
[00:01:26.570] - Speaker 1
I don't trust the hospital at all. Go to Don José, if you see that they're going to kill him.
[00:01:30.700] - Speaker 2
Almost, they almost killed him for a little bit.
[00:01:33.690] - Speaker 1
And for nothing, and it turned out better, almost ending up in the ICU.
[00:01:39.470] - Speaker 2
Even in the ICU they're roasting him, they've already given him his marching orders.
[00:01:41.470] - Speaker 1
Did you hear about Don José? Of course, Doña Dilma took him to have his catheter changed, because they left it in so he could toast his prostate. It had become blocked, so she took him to the hospital to have it changed. And there, the nurse on duty sent another nurse to change it, and I don't know if she did it too roughly, or if she didn't know what to do, but when they told her about the bleeding, it was like turning on a tap. And he had a heart attack, two pre-heart attacks, and they sent him to the ICU, where he was until yesterday when they let him out. On top of that, they gave him an injection and he turned purple, purple, purple, and got a bacterial infection in his blood. Nobody killed him. It wasn't his time, but imagine going to the hospital for one thing and imagine how you come out, I mean, how can you trust them? And for something so simple.
[00:02:30.310] - Speaker 2
Exactly. And that hospital in Carmen, tell me about it.
[00:02:32.660] - Speaker 3
They put the probe in you and pour a liquid into it so that you blow with that liquid inside and it doesn't come out. And no, I don't know if that's what they did to him.
[00:02:42.560] - Speaker 1
And for it to come out, it's the same thing, they have to take it out. Because I'm leaving.
[00:02:46.980] - Speaker 3
And then yes. And then yes. And then the probe.
[00:02:48.210] - Speaker 1
And I don't know what it says. Or the nurse was turning it on and I didn't turn it off.
[00:02:53.050] - Speaker 2
Those walls, there aren't any, they're just walls, they say: Go and imagine how many walls there are.
[00:02:57.910] - Speaker 1
Sure, I think he thought he was having a heart attack. And he was in bad shape, he was in the ICU for about eight days, and just yesterday they let him out. I was going to marry him.
[00:03:10.000] - Speaker 2
No, they didn't bring it.
[00:03:12.440] - Speaker 1
So, one says, imagine, a town But that's one of those hospitals.
[00:03:16.100] - Speaker 2
With a sick person, and people were arriving: There's one outside, help me, come on, get him out of there, this is a cemetery, several people have died here.
[00:03:29.380] - Speaker 1
Yes, I like it. Well, the time they brought him from Cunda and brought him What was he suffering from? A toothache, I think he had a toothache, something like that. And they gave him diclofenac... No, a... Yes, diclofenac, I think it was. And suddenly his skin started turning purple, purple, purple, and they threw him out when he got to Girardo, he was already dead. Believe me, it was because of pain... They killed him there in the heat. No, I'm not lying, because he had gotten something in his eye and it hurt a lot. And they went and gave him diclofenac, and supposedly it was diclofenac, but the batch of diclofenac that had arrived had expired. And I took it, look, and he ended up dead because of something that got in his eye. Imagine what you can expect.
[00:04:15.150] - Speaker 2
You can expect no one.
[00:04:16.500] - Speaker 1
No, by the time you get to the hospital, you already have to be in a very, very critical condition to be able to get to the hospital, to be able to
[00:04:24.400] - Speaker 2
On Saturday, I was screaming from a headache and calling the hospital. I told her, "No, don't take me to the hospital, leave me here. When will the motorcycle be ready? Leave me here."
[00:04:32.890] - Speaker 1
What did the doctor say? No, it's normal, there's nothing wrong with her, we'll just stitch her up, like sewing a button, and that's it. And she had a headache she couldn't stand. Finally, I had to take her to the doctor and I said, "How can you let her leave with a headache? Send her back, please, have them do some tests on her head or something." And after arguing with the doctor so much, I said, "Okay, fine, we'll send her in." They sent her to get help, and when she got there, she had fractures all over. This bone was damaged. Her whole face. And she had all these fractures here and here. And they were going to send her home like that. I can imagine bringing her here, to Chinita, in that kind of pain. That's useless. And.
