Yes, of course. It's not Except that it bites because it lives in the countryside. Yes, of course. It's very common in communities.

And do you know how they prevented a snake bite? Before a bite?
[00:01:03.620] - Speaker 1
Well, when you're in a different place, you have to be very careful not to come across a snake. And if you do find one, I don't usually kill them or chase them away, I just let them go.
[00:01:17.590] - Speaker 2
Yes, exactly. And what would you do if a snake bit you?
[00:01:25.110] - Speaker 1
Well, one would go to the health center immediately.

Would you go to the hospital in Carmen? Yes, of course. And would you trust the hospital in Carmen to treat a snake bite?
[00:01:38.590] - Speaker 1
No, because you know they don't have antivenom there, which is what they give you. You have to get there and then be transferred to another clinic.
[00:01:50.020] - Speaker 2
And would you trust other hospitals to treat a bite wound? Yes, of course. Okay. Girardoy, and what else?

Yes, Girardoy, Bagay, Espinal.
[00:01:59.030] - Speaker 2
And if you need to go to the hospital, is it difficult for you or is it easy to get there from here?
[00:02:05.520] - Speaker 1
No, I'm not transporting a motorcycle here; someone is transporting it quickly on a motorcycle.
[00:02:09.220] - Speaker 2
And where do you feel most likely to be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:02:18.150] - Speaker 1
In the countryside.
[00:02:19.010] - Speaker 2
Why?
[00:02:20.230] - Speaker 1
Because you always live in the countryside and in the mountains, suddenly you find one And I found one. Would you like it?
[00:02:26.710] - Speaker 2
Sure, okay. Bravas. Yes. And do you know how to identify poisonous snakes or venomous snakes? Yes, of course. And how do you identify snakes?
[00:02:41.610] - Speaker 1
Because of the color. Okay.
[00:02:45.010] - Speaker 2
And do you know of any cases of snake bites? No, there aren't any. No. Okay. Well, I don't have any more questions, but do you have anything else to say about snakes, your knowledge of snakes, or anything else?
[00:02:59.620] - Speaker 1
No, no, no.
[00:03:02.050] - Speaker 2
It's important to know that after a snake bite, you need to go straight to the hospital, and it's important to know what kind of snake bit you. Of course, of course. Because there are different antivenoms for different snakes. Yes, of course. And you can take a picture of the snake or you can kill it and take it to the hospital. But yes, that's the most important thing, and I don't have anything else. Thank you very much for your time. Very kind, thank you.
