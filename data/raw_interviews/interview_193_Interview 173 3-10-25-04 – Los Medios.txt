And how many years have you lived here, in El Carmen?
[00:00:26.050] - Speaker 1
I've lived here all my life.
[00:00:27.430] - Speaker 2
Yes, well. And so, do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:34.290] - Speaker 1
Yes, if someone suddenly bites a snake, they would rush to take it to the village as quickly as possible, if they have time to take it, because once you're there, you don't know what else to do.
[00:00:47.420] - Speaker 2
But it's likely to find a snake here, don't you think?
[00:00:53.230] - Speaker 1
Sometimes they do, but it's very Sometimes. Sometimes alone. Yes, sometimes they do, sometimes you find them in the soup. And have any of your animals been bitten by a snake, like a pet, livestock, a chicken? The other time a snake bit me on that side, but that was about two years ago.
[00:01:18.400] - Speaker 2
Do you know how to prevent or avoid a snake bite? No. What would you do if you were bitten by a snake?
[00:01:30.400] - Speaker 1
Take it quickly, take it to town, because that's the fastest way. Yes, because you don't really know what you're going to do.
[00:01:37.850] - Speaker 2
And would you trust the hospital in town to cure a snake bite?
[00:01:43.450] - Speaker 1
Yes, one that you know. I think that's what you're going to take there, right? And the other thing is that what I'm saying is that first you have to find a way to kill the snake to see what kind of snake bit you. That's the other thing, you have to know for yourself, because you can't go to school to learn that
[00:02:06.910] - Speaker 2
And would you trust other hospitals to treat a snake bite?
[00:02:13.350] - Speaker 1
One has to go to the hospital, and I'm closer. Yes, that's the fastest way.
[00:02:19.040] - Speaker 2
And if you need to go to the hospital, is it difficult for you or is it easy from here?
[00:02:29.170] - Speaker 1
Sometimes, when you get a car or something, they can take it away quickly, it's easy, but when they don't, you have to wait until you get it, even if the fire department or ambulance comes. Yes, that's the worst
[00:02:44.390] - Speaker 2
And where do you feel most likely to be bitten by a snake? In the countryside, at home, or where?
[00:02:51.440] - Speaker 1
In the countryside, you have to go out to work, which is what you do most Because here at home you keep everything clean, but out there you go out to the mountains, to the pastures, to clear brush or something, and that's where you can quickly get bitten by a bug.
[00:03:09.050] - Speaker 2
And do you know how to tell if a snake is poisonous or not?
[00:03:14.390] - Speaker 1
Snakes, yes, all the snakes you see, I'm terrified of them. I'm getting out of here, and if I can get away, great, right?
[00:03:25.760] - Speaker 2
Sure.
[00:03:27.180] - Speaker 1
Yes, that one.
[00:03:28.260] - Speaker 2
And do you know of any cases of snake bites?
[00:03:32.650] - Speaker 1
No, God knows I don't.
[00:03:33.880] - Speaker 2
Well, I don't have any more questions, but do you have anything else to say about snakes, your knowledge of snakes, anything else?
[00:03:43.690] - Speaker 1
No.
[00:03:44.680] - Speaker 2
Well, the most important information is that after a snake bite, you need to go to the hospital, right? To the hospital, no more. Yes, no more. And it's important to know what kind of snake bit you, because there are different antivenoms for different snakes. You can take a picture of the snake or you can kill it and take it to the hospital.
[00:04:08.650] - Speaker 1
Yes, that's the easiest thing to do. I can take the photos. But you come back bitten and scared, and the first thing you do is see if you can kill it. You don't put it in the photo.
[00:04:20.220] - Speaker 2
But yes, that's the most important thing, and that's all I have. Thank you very much for your time, you're very kind.
[00:04:27.990] - Speaker 1
Okay.
