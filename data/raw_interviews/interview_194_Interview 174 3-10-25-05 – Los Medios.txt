Do you have children? No. How many years have you lived here in El Carmen?
[00:00:26.180] - Speaker 2
Three years.
[00:00:29.120] - Speaker 1
So, do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:33.780] - Speaker 2
Of course, we're exposed to that. And in the area where I live, even more so, because it's mountainous terrain.
[00:00:40.190] - Speaker 1
Sure. And have any of your animals been bitten by a snake, such as a pet, livestock, or a chicken?
[00:00:49.620] - Speaker 2
No, not at the moment.
[00:00:52.540] - Speaker 1
And do you know how to prevent or avoid a snake bite before you get bitten?
[00:01:00.340] - Speaker 2
It depends on where you are. Because imagine, if you are far away, you have to make a tourniquet to prevent the fluid, the snake's venom, from passing through.
[00:01:13.340] - Speaker 1
But before you get bitten, do you have any methods of prevention?
[00:01:21.010] - Speaker 2
No.
[00:01:21.460] - Speaker 1
Right? Okay. And what would you do if a snake bit you?
[00:01:27.630] - Speaker 2
If you have a neighbor, if you are far away, call a neighbor to take them to the hospital and they will see what Of course, and if the person who picks up the phone saw the snake, take a picture to see what kind of snake it is.
[00:01:41.320] - Speaker 1
And would you go to the hospital in Carmen or another hospital?
[00:01:45.770] - Speaker 2
That would be the closest one.
[00:01:48.010] - Speaker 1
And would you trust the hospital in Carmen to treat a snake bite? No. Why not?
[00:01:54.730] - Speaker 2
No, they don't have the main methods for treating that snake bite there.
[00:02:01.140] - Speaker 1
And would you trust other hospitals to treat a snake bite?
[00:02:05.790] - Speaker 2
Yes, it would be time to go double, for that. Those more advanced places, you told me.
[00:02:11.170] - Speaker 1
And if you need to go to the hospital, is it easy for you or is it difficult from here?
[00:02:19.740] - Speaker 2
Well, since there are already motorcycles available for transportation, yes.
[00:02:25.430] - Speaker 1
And where do you feel most likely to be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home? No, in the countryside. Why?
[00:02:35.440] - Speaker 2
Because, of course, we are surrounded by the forest, or rather, the forest, grass, all of that.
[00:02:42.050] - Speaker 1
And do you know how to identify poisonous snakes?
[00:02:48.320] - Speaker 2
Yes, I've already been told which ones are poisonous and which ones aren't.
[00:02:52.250] - Speaker 1
And how do you identify the different snakes? By their color, their head, their skin.
[00:02:59.560] - Speaker 2
There's one on my head, others because they have a line, and four noses.
[00:03:09.700] - Speaker 1
And do you know of any cases of snake bites?
[00:03:13.340] - Speaker 2
No, not so far.
[00:03:16.970] - Speaker 1
Well, I don't have any more questions, but do you have anything else to say about snakes, your knowledge of snakes, or anything else?
[00:03:26.890] - Speaker 2
No, not so far.
[00:03:29.560] - Speaker 1
And well, it's important to know that after a snake bite, you need to go straight to the hospital and it's important to know what kind of snake bit you, because there are different antivenoms for different snakes. And you know, but you can take a picture of the snake or you can kill it and take it to the hospital. And tourniquets are not recommended for snake bites, because it's important that the blood can circulate in the body. And yes, that's all I have. Thank you very much for your time. No, thank you. Yes. Very kind.
