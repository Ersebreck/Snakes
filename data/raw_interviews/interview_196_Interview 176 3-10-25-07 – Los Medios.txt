[00:00:30.510] - Speaker 2
So, do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:34.980] - Speaker 1
Of course, there are always risks.
[00:00:36.910] - Speaker 2

One night.
[00:00:50.350] - Speaker 1
Yes, a motorcycle hit her, he probably ran her over and took her out, messed up her eye and tongue. But one of those that eat frogs.
[00:01:01.650] - Speaker 2
It wasn't poisonous, no. Yes. And have any of your animals been bitten by a snake, such as livestock or a pet?
[00:01:11.470] - Speaker 1
No, the dog I had, yes, I think she bit me, for sure, a snake, because she started drooling, drooling, and no. And I found two little holes here on her arm. I think a snake bit her, because I poured gasoline on her to see if she had worms, and she didn't have worms there, so why didn't she have worms? I think a snake bit her.
[00:01:44.510] - Speaker 2
But did he survive?
[00:01:48.350] - Speaker 1
No, she died. Who's on the phone? She died.
[00:01:52.140] - Speaker 2
Who's speaking?
[00:01:54.230] - Speaker 1
We couldn't save her. We gave her medicine, no, not that. But yes, she did last that long, about 24 hours. She died after about 24 hours, I think. The poor animal suffered a lot. Yes, I think so. Yes. I think she was bitten by a snake.
[00:02:23.080] - Speaker 2
And do you know how to prevent or avoid a snake bite?
[00:02:28.720] - Speaker 1
Well, usually here, if someone bites you, you have to go to the hospital, right?
[00:02:32.570] - Speaker 2
But before a snake bite, do you have any methods of prevention?
[00:02:37.680] - Speaker 1
No, not really. Well, here they say you cut it off, crosswise, right? Or you can tie it up to stop the poison spreading, they say. But who knows if that's true or not.
[00:02:52.740] - Speaker 2
And what would you do if a snake bit you?
[00:02:55.380] - Speaker 1
Well, I say that maybe you should just tie yourself down or cut yourself off, right?
[00:02:58.960] - Speaker 2
Okay.
[00:02:59.990] - Speaker 1
I would say that, to see if suddenly the Maybe the snake's venom will come out, I would say.
[00:03:09.590] - Speaker 2
And would you go to the hospital too, or not? Sure, I'd have to go. And why wouldn't you go to the hospital in Carmen or somewhere else?
[00:03:17.730] - Speaker 1
No, it's Espinal's turn here, right? Because they say that's the antidote where they have it.
[00:03:24.890] - Speaker 2
And why wouldn't you go, Carmen? Because Espinal is better.
[00:03:28.700] - Speaker 1
Because in El Espinal they say that's where they have the antidote. They usually always send them there, to El Espinal.
[00:03:37.160] - Speaker 2
And if you need to go to the hospital, is it difficult for you or is it easy from here?
[00:03:45.120] - Speaker 1
No, it's always complicated. Right now there's one left like It's stuck in a traffic jam because of the roadworks they're doing right now. So the spine is left like... It's always a little difficult.
[00:04:03.200] - Speaker 2
Yes, of course. And where do you feel you are most likely to be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home? No, in the countryside.
[00:04:12.460] - Speaker 1
Why? Because you go out where you find them most, outside. Of course, they always come there, sometimes to the house. They always come. For example, now that it's raining, they're already looking for dry places.
[00:04:31.590] - Speaker 2
Can you tell if snakes are poisonous or venomous? Yes, I already have a rough idea of which ones are the most dangerous. And how do you identify snakes?
[00:04:47.270] - Speaker 1
The X, she has her marks well made. If you see that these aren't You already have a pretty good idea which ones are the fiercest.
[00:04:58.480] - Speaker 2
Yes. And do you know of a case of snake moribundity? No. Well, I don't have any more questions, but do you have anything else to say about snakes or your knowledge of snakes or anything else like that?
[00:05:15.670] - Speaker 1
No, hardly.
[00:05:16.940] - Speaker 2
Okay. And well, it's important to know that after a snake bite, you need to go straight to the hospital, and it's important to know what kind of snake bit you, because there are different kinds. And you can take a picture of the snake or you can kill it and take it to the hospital. But yes, that's all I have. Thank you very much for your time. Okay, that's all. Very kind of you. Okay.
