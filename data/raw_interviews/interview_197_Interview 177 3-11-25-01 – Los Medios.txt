[00:00:10.060] - Speaker 2
And how old are you?
[00:00:15.460] - Speaker 3
76.
[00:00:16.420] - Speaker 1
And what do you do for a living? No, here on the little farm. Are you married or single? Married. Do you have children?
[00:00:25.330] - Speaker 3
Three children.
[00:00:26.390] - Speaker 1
And how many years have you lived here, in El Carmen?
[00:00:29.730] - Speaker 3
About 10 years ago.
[00:00:32.130] - Speaker 1
So, do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:38.150] - Speaker 3
Yes, it is possible that the event may occur.
[00:00:41.570] - Speaker 1
Yes.
[00:00:42.350] - Speaker 3
Yes, of course.
[00:00:43.160] - Speaker 1
Okay, yes. Why is that likely?
[00:00:45.580] - Speaker 3
From what they say, I haven't seen them very often. Very few. The ones I've seen are very small. I saw one once up there, near Pasqueño, around there, one that crossed the road.
[00:01:02.520] - Speaker 2
But she was black with white.
[00:01:06.450] - Speaker 3
Who knows what it is? Do you know what it's called? Black and white.
[00:01:12.830] - Speaker 1
It wasn't poisonous, I think.
[00:01:16.650] - Speaker 3
All of a sudden, is that true? I saw a green one here, like grass. So they say that one isn't poisonous. Yes. So that's the one the little ones are looking for? And isn't that the same thing?
[00:01:31.120] - Speaker 1
No, I don't think so. I don't think so. Well, have any of your animals ever been bitten by a snake, like a pet, a pet, livestock? No. And do you know how to prevent or avoid a snake bite?
[00:01:54.880] - Speaker 3
No, honestly not.
[00:01:56.060] - Speaker 1
And what would you do if a snake bit you?
[00:01:59.680] - Speaker 3
I would go to the hospital quickly; it wasn't the only thing. Honestly, I don't know how they got lost or how patients are treated when they are bitten by an animal.
[00:02:12.820] - Speaker 1
Would you go to the hospital in Carmen or somewhere else?
[00:02:16.320] - Speaker 3
Yes, to Carmen, that would be the only faster part.
[00:02:19.380] - Speaker 1
And would you trust the hospital, in Carmen, to cure a snake bite?
[00:02:23.600] - Speaker 3
The truth is that you go there hoping that they will help you. Yes, because would you trust other hospitals to cure snake bites? They say that in Giradot or Espinal, they have treatment for that.
[00:02:46.280] - Speaker 1
And if you need to go to the hospital, is it difficult for you or is it easy from here?
[00:02:55.090] - Speaker 3
Excuse me, I'm not telling you.
[00:02:56.490] - Speaker 1
If you need to go to the hospital, is it difficult? Is it easy for you or is it easy to get there from here?
[00:03:05.310] - Speaker 3
It's always difficult. Why? Yes, you have to find transportation, because if you can't drive, you have to find transportation, and that's always a bit difficult here, because there isn't much available. There are motorbike taxis, but they're not available all the time.
[00:03:25.510] - Speaker 1
Yes, of course. And where do you feel you're most likely to be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:03:38.170] - Speaker 3
In the countryside.
[00:03:39.220] - Speaker 1
Why?
[00:03:41.410] - Speaker 3
Because that's where most of them are Here at home, very few of them come around. Or if they do, you can tell that... The little ones that I sometimes see passing by or the green ones you see over there, but they don't come very close to the house.
[00:03:55.770] - Speaker 1
And do you know how to identify poisonous snakes? No, I don't know that. It's difficult, yes. And do you know of any cases of snake bites?
[00:04:11.490] - Speaker 3
Don Tulio's wife, who was bitten by a snake Snake is the only thing I have ever known.
[00:04:16.880] - Speaker 1
I have no further questions, but do you have anything else to say about snakes or your knowledge of snakes, or anything else?
[00:04:27.170] - Speaker 3
I would agree that there should be instructions, something that gives you a basic understanding of what to do and how to treat a patient who has been bitten by a snake. Yes, because around here, in my case, I don't know anything about that. Yes, the only thing to do is rush to the hospital, if it's one of those cases.
[00:04:56.710] - Speaker 1
Yes, and that's the most important thing to know. It's important to go straight to the hospital after a snake bite. And it's important to know what kind of snake bit you, because there are different antivenoms for different snakes. You can take a picture of the snake or you can kill it and take it to the hospital.
[00:05:18.280] - Speaker 3
And if you can do that, yes, it would be the most viable option, for the safety of the person who is going to treat you. Yes, exactly. They already know what animal it is and how to prevent it.
[00:05:32.110] - Speaker 1
Yes, yes, yes. And for prevention, it's important to clean your house, because snakes like trash; they like to hide in trash.
[00:05:49.280] - Speaker 3
They're staying around there.
[00:05:51.060] - Speaker 1
Yes. And it's important to wear boots in the field. It's also important to look carefully at night and always bring a flashlight with you. And yes, that's the most important thing for prevention.
[00:06:16.170] - Speaker 3
That would be the most
[00:06:17.970] - Speaker 2
How do you remove that?
[00:06:21.250] - Speaker 1
What? I'm sorry.
[00:06:22.310] - Speaker 2
How do you remove those walls?
[00:06:24.950] - Speaker 3
Let's say, to give you an idea, what would it be like? What would it be? Is there a chemical or something that can be used to maintain it?
[00:06:34.420] - Speaker 1
I don't know, but they say it's cryoline. Is it okay to spray it around the house?
[00:06:41.420] - Speaker 3
We do apply cryoline inside the walls. On the floor, in the corners.
[00:06:47.440] - Speaker 2
I killed one with
[00:06:49.740] - Speaker 3
With what? With Sartans, Lorban. With Lorban? Yes.
[00:06:56.460] - Speaker 2
I killed her because I was alone. I kept her in the laundry room, and that's where she was when I went to the laundry room. The maid told me, and And that's just now... How are you? But things were going badly. I poisoned her, the dog poison.
[00:07:26.810] - Speaker 1
Yes, yes, it could be. I don't really know if fumigation is effective for keeping snakes away, but I think it is. It's a good idea.
[00:07:43.080] - Speaker 3
Yes, they say that Creolina keeps them away a little, the smell of the cream.
[00:07:49.420] - Speaker 2
Do we have it here as a cream at all times?
[00:07:51.500] - Speaker 3
Yes, we don't need it here, as far as we can remember, we almost always have it. But that doesn't work for him. Yes, we sometimes put it on when we leave, because we have to go to Bogotá to see a doctor, so we put it on the doors under the beds, so that it will be ready when we leave, so that we can go. Yes, it's not a possibility, yes.
[00:08:23.090] - Speaker 1
But yes, that's all I have. Well, yes, yes. Thank you very much for your time. No, yes, thank you very much. Very kind, thank you very much.
