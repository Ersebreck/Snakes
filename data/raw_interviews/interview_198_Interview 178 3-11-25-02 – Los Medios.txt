[00:00:02.160] - Speaker 1
Evelio Barrera. Luis Evelio Barrera.
[00:00:05.680] - Speaker 2
And do you agree to the recording and interview?
[00:00:09.990] - Speaker 1
I have to accept it because, in any case, it may or may not be necessary. Because at my age, as I was telling you, there have been snakes. I was telling you that a snake bit me. I said that one of those animals bit me and I was dying. The child was poisoned. Without realizing it, I had been bitten by a snake three days earlier. Finally, my brother told me on the first day that it was poison. One was running away while we were harvesting. It moved me over here. It was already there, even my friends, the lady stole it from me. The healer cured me. And then I already mentioned... And here, here in the house, look, that man stopped you. Right there at the door, I killed a furebra, a mastacanada, you know those animals. I saw a newspaper that said there are 28 of that variety. And how old are you? 89.
[00:01:36.080] - Speaker 2
And what do you do for a living, if you work?
[00:01:38.910] - Speaker 1
I'm here, doing what little I can here, on the little ranch, here. And the little plot of land, because the little plot is 3,100 m².
[00:01:47.940] - Speaker 2
Are you married or single?
[00:01:51.270] - Speaker 1
Now that he's single.
[00:01:53.180] - Speaker 2
And how many years have you lived here, in El Carmen?
[00:01:59.220] - Speaker 1
About 10 years.
[00:02:01.470] - Speaker 2
And do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here?
[00:02:07.400] - Speaker 1
Well, one is not a fortune teller and does not know how the animal will respond if it knows the child. It knows, but they do not. Who knows which one it is? The child's. It knows where it was born, but not where it will die.
[00:02:25.670] - Speaker 2
Has any of your animals been bitten by a snake, such as a pet, livestock, or a chicken?
[00:02:35.690] - Speaker 1
Here I show you a chicken, as proof of that. And since I was on the coast, I took care of a mule with a hook, the Antiofico. And a man too. Because I hunted a lot of deer, because there are a lot of deer on the coast. So, if I saw a deer, I would let it go, but I was on the lookout and threw dirt on the ground, because that disease bit it a lot. The deer doesn't have to go anymore.
[00:03:07.280] - Speaker 2
And do you know how to prevent or avoid a snake bite?
[00:03:14.810] - Speaker 1
Well, that's inevitable, as long as the animal is fierce. Because anyway, if you see one and you can't kill it easily, you leave it alone, because it will bite you. They say that it's not scary, but even the fiercest animals are afraid of it. A snake will strike it once or twice and it won't do anything, you see. It comes right down. It happened to me. And I've killed them here, completely, over there in the other shack.
[00:03:54.850] - Speaker 2
And what would you do if a snake bit you?
[00:03:59.570] - Speaker 1
It's like putting on a garter belt and then suddenly putting on a jacket. You have to know what kind of jacket it could be, like a boiled egg. You have to know how to cook it and how to put it on. Or what do you think?
[00:04:22.850] - Speaker 2
Would you go to the hospital after a bite?
[00:04:27.350] - Speaker 1
No, I went to a healer. A healer. Of course, hospitals also heal with him. I mean, the healer doesn't heal with plants.
[00:04:40.630] - Speaker 2
Do you understand? Yes. And who is the healer?
[00:04:45.170] - Speaker 1
That was in Barranca, Barranca de Esmeja, over there. That man has died now; he was 93 years old.
[00:04:54.820] - Speaker 2
So, where do you feel more likely to get bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:05:06.240] - Speaker 1
That's not how I understand it.
[00:05:08.120] - Speaker 2
Where do you feel most likely to be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home? Where do you feel most likely to be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:05:13.410] - Speaker 1
Does it bite or does it move? It bites. Good. You can't tell. It's right there, because at any moment, a snake could appear. We're just starting here, someone goes outside and doesn't see it and steps on it. And there it is. And here, for example, the little snake I killed there. I've killed a lot of snakes here, right here and over there. And over there, in the middle, I killed a big one. And I said, "But what's that string there?" And it was already between dark and light, and I was going to do it when the shepherd said, "No, that happened to me. When it happened, look closely." And I saw that it was a snake. And it was already like this, a bit like a chicken, yes, but snakes are always killed by the head.
[00:06:12.400] - Speaker 2
And do you know how to identify poisonous snakes?
[00:06:19.100] - Speaker 1
Well, some. There are two kinds, two green ones. One is not dangerous, the other is dangerous. Like the cold earth, it's green, but it's poisonous. It bit its brother alive twice. He stepped on it, and when it bit him, I stepped on it harder than I could, like in a song. And it bit him again. And you couldn't even tell where. We can even see it in bed. When people see me like this, believing things, sometimes they don't believe me. I haven't believed in the good ones, but there must be some. That time the snake came back to me, there with my brother on the farm, talking to us, at my feet was a little snake, an X, an Amgen. A little while later, we went to bed, and in the area where I was going to sleep, there was another one. And I thought, "Is one of them going to stay here and bite me, or what?
[00:07:29.118] - Speaker 1
" When I don't turn on the light, the animal bites me, because it's an animal. And here we killed a female snake. And it started after I killed it, after I already
[00:07:44.150] - Speaker 1
You already know which one is the silly one, the one that does nothing, has no venom.
[00:07:47.480] - Speaker 2
Yes.
[00:07:48.460] - Speaker 1
I was doing what I wanted, making one of these things, which ran away. And then my daughter came and said, "Hey, is that snake real or fake?" And I said, "What snake? I don't have one, I don't even know where I put it. I already made one." And suddenly I looked and it was as thick as my arm. And it had this thing. I should have killed it, man, stretched it out, written it down somewhere far away, thrown it away. Because that animal eats other animals, it's a killer.
[00:08:34.310] - Speaker 2
And do you know of any cases of snake bites?
[00:08:40.190] - Speaker 1
He bit himself with a string, yes, one that Sometimes I remember that I didn't remember because I'm not good with dates. I've given up on life, but I used to sell drinks. She was the lady. And I'm very drunk, too drunk. No one is going to sell me booze like that, to take away and put on that side. When they call me in the morning and call me and call me and I go. I go, because I'm not going to move anymore. I don't know when he said to me, "What happened, man? No booze?" No, it's not booze. It's just that so-and-so was bitten by a snake, and I told him, 'Don't give him any money,' and he said, 'Go to Julio Palma.' And he's answering me with those filthy words: 'That son of a devil didn't want to go. Oh, brother, I'd like to go, but I can't. You have to take me. You know what I'm doing, but I can't walk.
[00:09:44.597] - Speaker 1
So they picked me up in Juanjo and took me there, and I already had some injections to go to a farm. I leave and I look: Hey, this has happened to you. If not, I'll get involved.
[00:10:00.230] - Speaker 1
But anyway, go to the farm where my father worked and ask him to lend me the two injections he had left, because the treatment at that time was six, not like now. Because that was in '62. But as soon as you leave, I can feel you coming here. And yes, that's how it was. I arrived and yes, I gave him the first one. And well, you go to the bank and make the arrangements to buy it. I didn't know how it worked. I gave it to her. During the whole trip, I had already fixed myself up a little with the red wine and the tobacco. I went home and at two in the afternoon I was back here. Because anyway And she said, "Where did you get it?" I gave her the treatment and... And that was it, I didn't see that she had any abnormalities, no, I didn't, fine. And I was the one who created that injection. But you have to check.
[00:11:11.010] - Speaker 1
Because now, lately, you have to know exactly what's wrong with someone in order to know the right treatment. And first, whatever it was, there shouldn't be any problems with the injection.
[00:11:28.390] - Speaker 1
The waterfall, which was a It's rubbish, but it's enough. And that gave me the idea, I followed it. And that, where there's cane too, yes, you eat it, you stop.
[00:11:48.310] - Speaker 2
Yes. Well, I don't have any more questions, but do you have anything else to say about snakes, your knowledge of snakes, or anything else?
[00:11:59.340] - Speaker 1
No, if I had time to tell you everything, that would be great. But I'll start telling you, because, for example, when we were in Pereira, to go to Lombricitas, they didn't do anything, because there's one called Robo de Machete, another called Colbinata, which I imagine doesn't do anything either, Arrañosas. And there's one called Loboemachete, which gives you a fountain. It's a green one. There are a lot of them in the coffee plantations. And so on and so forth. And then when we started walking, one son went to Caldas, over there to do some tastings for Semana Caldas, over there, towards Cunebra, Brab. And then over there, no. We went to La Dorada and over there too. And then they transferred me to the coast and there he said: "How much worse." You had to walk around with someone watching your every move. It was very funny. And I've been there, as I just said, I've been very afraid of snakes, but I'm not going to leave because I'm afraid.
[00:13:17.863] - Speaker 1
No, no. Because that's how I had to fire a man. He didn't warn me. When he got there, where I was working, I had him scheduled for another physical.
[00:13:30.280] - Speaker 1
What happened, man? I'm not a big shot, that's why I left. I said, "Well, let's go kill her." I didn't think But I said to myself, "I fell because at that point... From all the walking and the way I am. Don't you see that I was there, I don't know what, and I slept with the shotgun, with the comb, they'll blow me away. My brother, for God's sake, the enemy, we can't let him get away. As long as you can defend yourself, because if the enemy screws you over, the rest of us will have to figure out how to sell ourselves. That's why, you know what? Send more work. See? That's the one.
[00:14:21.470] - Speaker 2
Well, yes. And well, I don't have any more, but it's important to know about bruising afterwards. Because there's a little snake called a patoco.
[00:14:34.750] - Speaker 1
And then they get there. It has an X. Yes. Right?
[00:14:39.630] - Speaker 2
Yes, yes.
[00:14:41.250] - Speaker 1
And that's my wife. And over at Hermana Mía's farm, I loved being there. And yes, if you get bitten by a snake, it's important to go straight to the hospital.
[00:14:57.170] - Speaker 2
Sure. And it's important that there aren't any. Because that's the first thing I ask around here.
[00:15:02.830] - Speaker 1
Let's see if there are any healers like composers. I didn't know what time someone breaks down, like it happened to me. Okay, because in reality, we're not going to talk about doctors anymore, but that's the only thing I don't know. They know how to treat and fix broken bones and all that crap. Although there are a lot of broken bones that get fixed too. Do you know how? But those people are gone now. So that's where it is, because that's the problem. And that's how it is around here. Here, if it's not the doctors or the hospital, you're screwed. Because where else can you go? For example, I'm here and a snake bites me: When am I going to go to Barranca? And that time when the snake died, I said to myself: My brother, I'm going to Yondó. Right in front of the mouth. There's a man there who's a healer and the big one, and his son, the doctor, medicine. There he goes, I'm going to borrow from everyone.
[00:16:20.439] - Speaker 1
I'm going there with more confidence. But in the end, I ran into the right man and fell down, and a footprint, a good guy, I'm going to play there.
[00:16:35.030] - Speaker 2
And yes, it is important to know which snake bit you, because there are different antivenoms for different snakes. You can take a photo of the snake or you can kill it and take it to the hospital. But that is the most important thing, and I don't have any more information. Thank you very much.
[00:16:56.100] - Speaker 1
But it's best not to let the animal touch it yet.
[00:16:59.980] - Speaker 2
Yeah, I would have been the fool.
[00:17:03.740] - Speaker 1
Yes.
[00:17:07.560] - Speaker 2
Thank you very much for your time. You're very kind. Thank you.
[00:17:11.360] - Speaker 1
Everything is necessary.
