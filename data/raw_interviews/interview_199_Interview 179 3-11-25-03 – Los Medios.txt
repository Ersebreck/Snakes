The mountains, then. Yes, because if they sometimes come out of the mountains, then you often don't see them in the apartments. Yes, okay. So they can see you. And if you go to the doctor, you die soon, that's how it used to be.

Why Girardot?
[00:02:13.830] - Speaker 4
I have the Girardón company, which is in El Carmen. When you're there, I don't know. I don't know, he told me. I don't understand. You're not always going to turn.
[00:02:27.000] - Speaker 1
And if you need to go to the hospital, is it difficult for you or is it easy from here?
[00:02:35.290] - Speaker 4
Sometimes you always end up going, because instead of not going, you always Yes, always... Transportation. Transportation. Yes, of course.
[00:02:48.860] - Speaker 1
And where do you feel most likely to be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:02:59.060] - Speaker 4
In the countryside. No. Okay.
[00:03:01.660] - Speaker 1
Why?
[00:03:03.750] - Speaker 4
Because here there's almost nothing Because they're already coming out in the woods, so... Right, yes. So, one suddenly comes along and suddenly doesn't do it, right? Yes, of course. Because you see a snake over there, you scare it away. Yes, of course. So, then one more... If instead of scaring it, they scare you away. Or if you... You see if you can catch it. Yes, catch it, whatever there is. For example, there's one called the mitago. They're easy to catch because you already know them. But there are some that are red, you see the red colors, those are... Yes, of course. They're fierce. So, you get scared and then you...
[00:03:49.200] - Speaker 1
Yes, well. And do you know of any cases of snake bites?
[00:03:58.740] - Speaker 4
Not around here.
[00:04:02.150] - Speaker 1
Okay. Well, I don't have any more questions, but do you have anything else to say about snakes or your knowledge of snakes or anything else?
[00:04:12.910] - Speaker 4
No.
[00:04:14.580] - Speaker 1
Well, it's important to know what to do after a snake bite and whether you need to go to the hospital. And it's important to know what kind of snake bit you because there are different antivenoms for different snakes. You can take a picture of the snake or you can kill it and take it to the hospital. But that's the most important thing to know.
[00:04:43.410] - Speaker 4
You have to be careful with payments, as I said.
[00:04:46.470] - Speaker 1
Yes, because necklaces
[00:04:48.810] - Speaker 2
If the person dies, the head has to be shown somewhere, because the first thing I said to him in the The head. What quality, what class, what stature. Yes.
[00:05:01.390] - Speaker 1
Beeps and buzzes.
[00:05:04.300] - Speaker 2
Now, as you were playing there in front of your house, you didn't see a long mark there where the cars had run over it. It was there all over the road.
[00:05:14.450] - Speaker 1
When?
[00:05:15.440] - Speaker 2
Now you're being unfair. You passed by, you were walking, I was coming too, I saw her there.
[00:05:22.130] - Speaker 1
I saw it as a snake, but I don't think it was a carving.
[00:05:27.380] - Speaker 2
The one I saw was size X. That one was called size X.
[00:05:32.410] - Speaker 4
Did you see that?
[00:05:35.060] - Speaker 1
How scary. And they're fierce. There are lots of sizes here.
[00:05:39.450] - Speaker 2
You're going to see him. Yes, quite a lot. Yes, that's what I tell him. They always get killed by cars, you know, the prostitutes. But in prison. For example, there aren't many customers here.
[00:05:49.090] - Speaker 4
But yes, instead of saying, over there. Yes, there are many.
[00:05:53.190] - Speaker 3
No, in winter, I want to find something warm. They come out of the woods and look for the driest places to warm up, so they don't have to stay out there. They look for clearings, like that part of the woods. Yes, that's right, that's what they have there.
[00:06:06.140] - Speaker 4
They can't go back to one. At night they go over there. Yes. Once, a few days ago, I had some chickens and a pigsty, and I went over there to leave them. And I was there for a while and I saw something moving there, and I looked at it and said, "What is that? It's like a rag," and I looked at it, but I didn't And yes, it was a snake. Alive? The one that killed the boy. So you didn't know it. He said, "No, it's a dangerous snake." Antonio went and looked at it and said, "It's a dangerous snake." So, yes, he killed it. But it didn't start going through the grass, it went over there. But here it hasn't been identified.
[00:06:55.930] - Speaker 1
And thank you very much, that's all I have. Thank you very much for your knowledge, it's very important. Well, yes, ma'am.
