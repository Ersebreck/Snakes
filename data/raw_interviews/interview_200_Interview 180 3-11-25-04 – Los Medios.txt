[00:00:52.850] - Speaker 1
I lived here for a while. After I turned 13, I left. I was gone for 20 years, then I came back. But after 20 years, I came back here again. And to all my families, brothers, sisters.
[00:01:09.990] - Speaker 2
So, do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here?
[00:01:17.550] - Speaker 1
How likely?
[00:01:18.660] - Speaker 2
You are likely to be bitten by a snake here. Do you think so or not? Yes. Why?
[00:01:29.410] - Speaker 1
Because how do they manage to see the last one, for example, there's already one, let's say, tonight, at this time of night, who's going to take it out? I mean, take it away because transportation is so bad. Yes. The only ones are the motorcycles out there and the motorcycles that come there, but you know that
[00:01:51.320] - Speaker 2
Yes.
[00:01:52.410] - Speaker 1
If one goes, then one goes. But one has the ability, one I once saw a fierce snake, a man saw it, and I said to him, "Kill it and cut it open and take out its gallbladder. Take five drops." And the man did it, took out the gallbladder and took the five drops in a little water and continued working. Nothing happened to him, he's a very good man. Okay, interesting. Dad, that's what he taught us first. In case a snake bites you when you can't do much, bite it so I can see it, so I don't throw them away. And at first, you get scared when you see it. And then you come and cut it crosswise... Okay. Yes, so that when the skin comes off, it comes off on the right side, because then they're in a weird liquid. And any of your animals? Has your son ever been bitten by a snake, a pet, livestock?
[00:03:18.550] - Speaker 2
No. And do you know how to prevent or avoid a snake bite before you get bitten?
[00:03:28.080] - Speaker 1
To avoid one, you have to look. Of course. Look to see where they are. Because if you see the day she saw it there, she saw it there, but she didn't know what it was, it was wobbling there and it was an egg. Of course. It eats chickens, it eats chickens. It was good for that, for eating chickens. We've already lost two little chicks. Yes, of course. An egg, yes. Yes, you have to intervene, you have to intervene. For example, as you ask me, one here, in the late afternoon, you go out into the yard, look, they're coming and resting in the yard of the house, in the corridor. Instead of going inside and hiding under everything, anything there. Of course. And there they are.
[00:04:21.690] - Speaker 2
Yes. And what would you do if a snake bit you? What would you do if a snake bit you?
[00:04:31.420] - Speaker 1
What would you do? Well, so that you can do a Nothing, why would you do that?
[00:04:40.020] - Speaker 2
Would you go to the hospital or not?
[00:04:42.510] - Speaker 1
But what? You go there and they move you around, they put you at the end of the line. Over there, here on the farm, the year before last, one of those animals bit us and the wound took two months to heal and they checked it at the end. They cut him from here to here, it bit him here, and they cut him from here, they did two operations.
[00:05:12.100] - Speaker 2
And he always stayed when he left the hospital, he always walks and he
[00:05:21.440] - Speaker 1
The animal falls due to an illness.
[00:05:22.740] - Speaker 2
Okay, yes.
[00:05:23.500] - Speaker 1
He should be thankful that it was just a bite and that he did it And it bit him, and he immediately went over to the butler at the other farm and said, "An animal bit me," and as soon as he said that, he fell down. And he looked and said, "No, a snake bit him." Because it's one of those snakes that's one of the most... And I checked him out on the motorcycle and once he was coming back in bad shape. And once he threw him on the motorcycle, and once he parked, and the cameraman called him at the end. He lasted two months, two months as a child. And the boss, practically everything I say, one because of working for a person like that who doesn't answer for the person, but where he sees knowledge and they take my license plate because he sees that I didn't even have insurance.
[00:06:11.120] - Speaker 2
And well, if you need to go to the hospital, is it difficult for you or is it easy to get there?
[00:06:21.030] - Speaker 1
In any case, one must seek a way to be healthy, seek a way to live, because what else can one do? Because if one stays there, one dies there. One must seek a way out, get there, instead of saying, "It's very serious, let's transfer him there." To go to the doctor, to finally give up, to go to the
[00:06:39.180] - Speaker 2
But I wouldn't go and do Carmen. No. Why not?
[00:06:45.100] - Speaker 1
No, and Carmen, that's only done there, they cut you, put gauze there, they grab you there, it's bad. I'm going to do it, it's bad.
[00:06:58.640] - Speaker 2
And where do you feel you are most likely to be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:07:05.650] - Speaker 1
In the countryside. Why? Because that's where they are.
[00:07:11.090] - Speaker 2
And do you know how to identify poisonous snakes or snakes that cause nine days of pain? Do you understand me? No. Do you know how to identify poisonous snakes or snakes that cause nine days of pain?
[00:07:30.220] - Speaker 1
Can you identify them?
[00:07:30.950] - Speaker 2
Identify them, yes.
[00:07:33.000] - Speaker 1
And the poisonous culbera, once identified, can be dangerous.
[00:07:39.120] - Speaker 2
And how do you identify snakes? By their color, their head, their skin?
[00:07:45.570] - Speaker 1
Because of their color. For example, the radiosacilla, the radiosacilla has, posgoña on its tail and head. So, they bite and sting like the lacra.
[00:08:00.400] - Speaker 2
Yes.
[00:08:04.390] - Speaker 1
So, do you know of any cases of snake morbicide?
[00:08:13.180] - Speaker 2
Do you know of a case?
[00:08:14.580] - Speaker 1
Well, back on the farm, the farm where I was too, about three years ago, there was a horse. I went there, already bleeding. It died at around eight in the morning, and by 11:00, it was dead, it was swelling up, it blew up, and those people were going to get their lottery tickets. And that's the dream, the farm had to pay people to look for it until they found it. Okay. It's like this, this thick, about a meter long, I'd say. Yes, okay.
[00:08:58.030] - Speaker 2
Well, I don't have any more questions, but you have more to say about snakes.
[00:09:02.390] - Speaker 1
No, I don't have any further comments either.
[00:09:04.840] - Speaker 2
Okay, perfect. And it's important to know to go straight to the hospital after a snake bite, and it's important to know what kind of snake bit you. You can take a picture, you can take it to the hospital. Sure. Because there are different antivenoms for different snakes.
[00:09:23.300] - Speaker 1
Sure. Yes.
[00:09:25.100] - Speaker 2
But thank you very much for your time and your knowledge. Very kind of you. Thank you.
[00:09:29.970] - Speaker 1
There aren't any.
