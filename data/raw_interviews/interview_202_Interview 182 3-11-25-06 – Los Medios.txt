And how many years have you lived here, in El Carmen?
[00:00:25.540] - Speaker 1
Still.
[00:00:26.860] - Speaker 2
Well, then, do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:32.270] - Speaker 1
Yes, suddenly, of course, you're walking pretty close to the ravine and all that, and the culeera is going to be there. Yes.
[00:00:39.950] - Speaker 2
Has any of your animals been bitten by a snake, such as a pet, livestock, or a chicken?
[00:00:47.080] - Speaker 1
Around here, you hear a lot about it, so you see dead cows and they say it's from the sting of a horsefly or something like that. And then, animals, chickens eat them, sometimes it's from the tail and stuff like that.
[00:00:59.370] - Speaker 2
Okay. And do you know how to prevent or avoid a snake bite?
[00:01:05.430] - Speaker 1
No, not really. No? No? Can you avoid the coleseras? No. I try to avoid them and stuff.
[00:01:12.550] - Speaker 2
Okay. And what would you do if a snake bit you?
[00:01:18.730] - Speaker 1
No, because trying to run through the hospital, because I don't know, let's say, like against something like that. Because around here there are quite a few people who say to use the yep from the boruco, something like that, several things like that. But who knows if that works.
[00:01:37.020] - Speaker 2
And would you go to the hospital in Carmen or somewhere else?
[00:01:42.520] - Speaker 1
Well, I think that, mainly, if there are people around, I think they send you to one, and there they always take you out as if they were taking you to Belgaria.
[00:01:50.660] - Speaker 2
Would you trust the hospital, in Carmen, to cure a woman in need of help? No. Why not?
[00:01:57.690] - Speaker 1
No, it's a hospital. It's like, "And you say hello there?" Yes, he says hello to me there. He calls me and texts me. Yes. No, I'm just going to go. They're very experienced at that, I think.
[00:02:09.390] - Speaker 2
And if you need to go to the hospital in Carmen, is it difficult for you or is it easy from here?
[00:02:19.590] - Speaker 1
Yes, no, I could go because I have transportation, which is the motorcycle that was made. Okay, good.
[00:02:25.610] - Speaker 2
And where do you feel most likely to be bitten by one? In the countryside or at home?
[00:02:33.550] - Speaker 1
No, well, it's just that at home Let's say, since we're used to dealing with that issue, with the culeras, the spiders and all that, we're used to fumigating and doing things like that. And that scares the kids away from school. And well, no, it's outside the house, mostly when you're working out there in the fields or in the ravine. Like that, or at night, even when it's raining on the road, you're walking and they can come out to get warm, and then you can... Because of the rain and all that.
[00:03:06.160] - Speaker 2
And do you know how to identify poisonous snakes or snakes that are venomous?
[00:03:11.030] - Speaker 1
No, I would say yes, but no, not really.
[00:03:17.030] - Speaker 2
And do you know of any cases of snake bites?
[00:03:22.420] - Speaker 1
Yes, here they are I know several people who have bitten the powder and stuff.
[00:03:28.490] - Speaker 2
Hello.
[00:03:30.230] - Speaker 1
Thank you, God has been saved.
[00:03:33.790] - Speaker 2
And, well, I don't have any more questions, but do you have anything else to say about snakes or your knowledge of snakes or anything else?
[00:03:42.600] - Speaker 1
No, you never know.
[00:03:45.570] - Speaker 2
And it's important to know that after a snake bite, it's important to go straight to the hospital. And it's important to know what kind of snake bit you, because there are different antivenoms for different snakes. And you can take a picture of the snake or you can kill it and take it to the hospital. But yes, that's the most important thing to know. And well, I don't have anything else. Thank you very much for your time. Thank you very much. You're very kind.
