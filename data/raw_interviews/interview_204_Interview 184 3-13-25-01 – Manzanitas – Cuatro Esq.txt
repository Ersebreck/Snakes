And how many years have you lived here, in El Carmen?
[00:00:42.410] - Speaker 2
All my life, since I was little. We were born here, in Carmen. We came here because in this neighborhood, in Carmen, there is work.
[00:00:54.380] - Speaker 1
So, do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here? Sure, and if they get bitten, they die.
[00:01:03.980] - Speaker 2
If you don't use the mild remedy and apply the old one they have for this They'll die, but it's poisonous.
[00:01:11.570] - Speaker 1
And do you think there's a chance of getting bitten by a snake here?
[00:01:18.360] - Speaker 2
Sure, there are a lot of snakes around here. If you step on its tail, it will bite you, because it will bite you, that's for sure, or you'll have to fight it off.
[00:01:27.490] - Speaker 1
Yes, of course. And have any of your animals been bitten by a snake, such as a pet or livestock?
[00:01:36.750] - Speaker 2
Of course, snakes kill cattle. Where I worked, they killed cows on the flat ground.
[00:01:44.990] - Speaker 1
And one bit into one
[00:01:47.080] - Speaker 2
The X. The X, it itches and stuff, I wouldn't let them have it. It kills dogs too, if they bite it, it kills them, that's what it is, they don't put drugs in it, he died.
[00:02:03.610] - Speaker 1
And do you know how to prevent or avoid one?
[00:02:09.180] - Speaker 2
But it's only the binding, where they bite and slash it, so that it doesn't die immediately, because if it's very poisonous, it kills it.
[00:02:20.760] - Speaker 1
And before a snake bite, do you have any methods for preventing bites?
[00:02:30.060] - Speaker 2
No, just go to the hospital and have them give you medicine that can stop the
[00:02:37.800] - Speaker 1
And yes, what would you do if you were bitten by a snake?
[00:02:44.210] - Speaker 2
Well then, the beauty has nothing else to do because she died. It's the last thing she does, because the baby can't do anything to her.
[00:02:57.860] - Speaker 1
Would you go to the hospital?
[00:03:00.190] - Speaker 2
Of course, you have to go to the hospital, and even then, if they don't give him the anti-hygromic serum quickly, he'll die. Up there, two people have already died from bites like that, bitten at a lady's school. It was a stupid snake, in a piece of banana, and I don't think it was poisonous. They took the other people too, and she died in the hospital.
[00:03:28.510] - Speaker 1
And would you go? And would you trust the hospital in Carmen or somewhere else? Carmen, in Desea.
[00:03:32.890] - Speaker 2
Instead, they go to Mero, which is in a neighborhood that's further away. Or to Hérida, which is now kind of like Hérida.
[00:03:45.130] - Speaker 1
And would you trust the hospital in Carmen to treat a snake bite?
[00:03:50.640] - Speaker 2
Sure, that's good too, the doctor there is good.
[00:03:55.780] - Speaker 1
And would you trust other hospitals to treat a bite wound?
[00:04:00.190] - Speaker 2
Of course, because that's where the medicine is, in the hospital.
[00:04:05.610] - Speaker 1
And if you need to go to the hospital, is it difficult for you or is it easy from here?
[00:04:13.990] - Speaker 2
It's hard to get there because hardly any cars pass by. That's how it is.
[00:04:22.040] - Speaker 1
And where do you feel most likely to be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:04:30.410] - Speaker 2
I mean, working at home too, because if you weren't paying attention, because I've killed several snakes, 10 snakes.
[00:04:42.370] - Speaker 1
Sure. Do you know how to identify poisonous and non-poisonous snakes?
[00:04:50.480] - Speaker 2
That tobajo, to tell you the truth, is poisonous, because the mitado grows thinking it's not poisonous, but it gets you drunk. Because the guaba isn't poisonous, it doesn't. No, if you don't tease it, it doesn't But the bajo, yes. The bajo is fierce.
[00:05:08.330] - Speaker 1
And how do you identify snakes? By their color, their head, their skin, how?
[00:05:17.070] - Speaker 2
To get to know it? Yes. To get to know it, because you already know what the metado is, what the zapa is, what the cascabez is, what the talla is, X, because there are several types, there's one that isn't poisonous, a thin one, a dumb one. It looks like a wick, but I teased it and teased it until it stung me.
[00:05:41.890] - Speaker 1
And do you know of any cases of snake bites?
[00:05:46.940] - Speaker 2
Sure, my brother got bitten by a mosquito leaving El Carmen.
[00:05:51.690] - Speaker 1
And did he go to the little light?
[00:05:53.220] - Speaker 2
And they took him to Luzita, he was little. And up there, it also bit my wife's cousin. I had to take him to the hospital, and I said, "Why are there so many cases of this? It's so expensive."
[00:06:09.340] - Speaker 1
And, well, I don't have any more questions, but you have more to say about snakes.
[00:06:15.590] - Speaker 2
No, ma'am, now.
[00:06:18.170] - Speaker 1
And, well, it's important to know what to do after a snake bite. It's important to go straight to the hospital and it's important to know what kind of snake it was because there are different antivenoms for different snakes. You can take a picture of the snake or you can kill it and take it to the hospital.
[00:06:41.580] - Speaker 2
Well, that hardly applies to wearing anything, because it's a no-no. At most, it goes away because it itches and you scratch it, and you don't pay attention to it. You never see the plant because it's
[00:06:54.350] - Speaker 1
Yes, that's true too. But if you can tell which snake died, that's good, because it is.
[00:07:04.310] - Speaker 2
Of course, one does know the name, the priest.
[00:07:07.100] - Speaker 1
But thank you, I don't have any more. Thank you very much for your time. You're welcome. Thank you. All right. Thank you, very kind.
