[00:00:33.220] - Speaker 2
See you later, take care. So, do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:41.520] - Speaker 1
Maybe, because there are a lot of poisonous snakes too. Yes, of course. Yes, maybe.
[00:00:48.960] - Speaker 2
Has any of your animals been bitten by a snake, such as a pet, livestock, or a chicken?
[00:00:56.780] - Speaker 1
Not mine. Mine, what my sister did bite. But not here. Not here.
[00:01:05.910] - Speaker 2
And do you know how to prevent or avoid a snake bite?
[00:01:11.040] - Speaker 1
Well, you can never be too careful. Sometimes people Well, yes, try not to go out at night. Watch your shoes, always be on the lookout, make sure it doesn't bite you. That's the only prevention you have, because you don't know anything else.
[00:01:30.610] - Speaker 2
And what would you do if a snake died?
[00:01:34.550] - Speaker 1
I think that the first thing to do is to seek help, because that would be the first thing to do. Because you often do things you shouldn't do, like applying a tourniquet, for example, which you know is Well, that's what they used to do, but I know you shouldn't do that anymore. You should seek help as soon as possible.
[00:01:58.460] - Speaker 2
Yes, well, yes. And would you go to the hospital in Carmen or somewhere else?
[00:02:04.310] - Speaker 1
I think another place where they can attend to you quickly, because they take a long time there. So while you're there, you waste a lot of time. Yes, of course. So it would be somewhere else.
[00:02:17.780] - Speaker 2
Yes, okay. And if you need to go to the hospital, is that difficult for you or is it easy?
[00:02:23.840] - Speaker 1
Well, no, I think it's easy. Although we're far from But for me it's easy.
[00:02:34.390] - Speaker 2
And where do you feel most likely to be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:02:45.980] - Speaker 1
In the countryside?
[00:02:47.120] - Speaker 2
Why?
[00:02:48.430] - Speaker 1
Because they sometimes get caught in the stubble or in the trees, in the stumps or in the bushes. Although sometimes they also get into the house. And you don't know, you don't see them. They might be in the bushes, when you're tidying them up, and you might find one.
[00:03:14.880] - Speaker 2
And do you know how to identify poisonous or novene-causing weeds?
[00:03:19.020] - Speaker 1
You kind of know what they are, like cascabel, size X, coral classes, some are others, some aren't. There are many, but you don't really know what they all are. Those are the ones you know are very poisonous. Yes, of course.
[00:03:42.750] - Speaker 2
And how do you identify different snakes? By their color?
[00:03:47.090] - Speaker 1
For the color. For the color. For the color.
[00:03:51.560] - Speaker 2
And do you know of any cases of snake bites?
[00:03:55.750] - Speaker 1
Well, no. We know of a woman who was bitten by one in another village and she died from the snake bite. Around here, there was another woman too. And my sister.
[00:04:08.080] - Speaker 2
And that's the one most people know about. I don't have any more questions, but do you have anything else to say about snakes or your knowledge of snakes?
[00:04:20.950] - Speaker 1
No, just that you have to be very careful when you go out, for example, in the dark. They lurk on the sides of the roads. So you have to be very careful. Wear boots. These are precautions.
[00:04:39.730] - Speaker 2
Yes, it's true.
[00:04:40.840] - Speaker 1
So that you don't
[00:04:42.760] - Speaker 2
And yes, you already know, but it's important after a snake bite to go to the hospital. And it's important to know what kind of snake bit you, because there are different kinds
[00:04:55.200] - Speaker 1
Yes, take her photo, identify her.
[00:04:57.150] - Speaker 2
Yes, exactly.
[00:04:58.340] - Speaker 1
To find out what they are going to give you. Exactly. Because there was another woman who was bitten by something and they gave her an antidote, but it turned out it wasn't a snake, it was another animal.
[00:05:10.170] - Speaker 2
One happy one, one spider. One spider.
[00:05:12.170] - Speaker 1
I think it was a spider, Liceudardo Garzón's. And she was left disabled forever. Because they gave her the antidote for a snake bite, but it turned out it wasn't a snake bite. Because they didn't see what it was, but they assumed it was a snake bite, but it wasn't a snake bite.
[00:05:35.130] - Speaker 2
Yes, it is important to know which animal or which snake.
[00:05:40.220] - Speaker 1
What an animal, a scorpion.
[00:05:41.260] - Speaker 2
Yes, exactly. So that's the problem. Yes, it's a problem. But yes, thank you very much. That's all I have. You're welcome. Thank you very much. You're very kind. That's too bad.
[00:05:54.860] - Speaker 1
Would you like something to drink?
[00:05:56.870] - Speaker 2
Do you take them?
[00:05:59.180] - Speaker 1
Water.
[00:05:59.760] - Speaker 2
Water? Yes, some water. That's fine, thank you.
