Just one. It was for Masses for everything.

Like eggs.
[00:00:20.090] - Speaker 2
Yes. They give birth. The one that lays eggs is the one that isn't poisonous, the one that lays eggs.
[00:00:27.610] - Speaker 3
Really? I didn't know that.
[00:00:29.450] - Speaker 2
And the poisonous one stops. She stops two or three balls and then the brains of nobody come out.
[00:00:35.830] - Speaker 3
I didn't know.
[00:00:37.450] - Speaker 2
And that's where the ones that aren't poisonous come in and help us eat. For example, if I don't eat a brain, and they give us a poisonous one, because the ones that aren't poisonous are eaten by the ninth ones, which are small. Yes. We have a garden.

How scary. Yes, how scary.

I was already on my way to the doctor and then it went away, it went away, but it was very hard, it really got to me. Was it a latrana? Maybe it was a latrana, but I didn't see it.
[00:01:38.890] - Speaker 2
Is that where the errors are?
[00:01:41.240] - Speaker 1
I didn't see it. I looked, and I think that when I pulled the bush like this, it stung me, and he fell into the water and was carried away by the current.
[00:01:50.560] - Speaker 2
That's why I didn't see it. But let's go with the normal one for now. Yes. Starting today, they're all going with this one.
[00:01:58.920] - Speaker 3
Yes. Yes. That's two with these. Yes. Three.
[00:01:59.840] - Speaker 1
It's about time.
