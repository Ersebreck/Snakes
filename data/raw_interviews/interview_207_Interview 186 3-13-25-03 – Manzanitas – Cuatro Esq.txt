[00:00:03.460] - Speaker 2

[00:00:06.570] - Speaker 2
And what do you do for a living?
[00:00:08.160] - Speaker 1
Six, six it is.
[00:00:09.330] - Speaker 2
Six, six.
[00:00:10.360] - Speaker 1
What do you do for a living? Right now, I live almost entirely off my rent; I don't work anymore.
[00:00:15.480] - Speaker 2
Are you married or single? Single. Do you have children?
[00:00:21.350] - Speaker 1
Sure, one older than me.
[00:00:24.930] - Speaker 2
And how many years ago? And do you live here, in Carmen?
[00:00:31.130] - Speaker 1
No, I've lived in Carmen my whole life. But I've been living here for a year.
[00:00:38.890] - Speaker 2
But here in Carmen, your whole life.
[00:00:41.360] - Speaker 1
Always in El Carmen, yes.
[00:00:43.150] - Speaker 2
So, do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:49.520] - Speaker 1
Let one bite another?
[00:00:50.960] - Speaker 2
It's a possibility.
[00:00:53.100] - Speaker 1
Let it bite one of the bites, yes. Is it possible or likely that a snake will bite you here? Of course.
[00:01:00.650] - Speaker 2
Why?
[00:01:02.330] - Speaker 1
Because, look, I wouldn't have noticed, but my son's mother-in-law killed a snake. It was back there on the hill where I used to live. But I think she died around that time because of How do you say it? Negligence, maybe. I mean, they didn't take her to the... Because a snake can bite you in a rush, if you get help right away, you don't die, nothing happens. But even though they gave her first aid, it was like 12 hours later, it was too late, or 3 o'clock. But it wasn't because... I mean, the people who lived with her didn't worry, and since she said she wasn't in any pain, they said nothing was wrong. An hour later, they brought her down, but it was too late, she was already dead. But I don't think it was Moricio. That was the person I know who was bitten, because later she was bitten in your neighborhood. Tulio, you know the woman who belongs to the man who cuts wood, what's his name?
[00:01:59.643] - Speaker 1
Ramírez. Ramiro. Do you know Ramiro? Yes. She was bitten by a snake in front of where I lived, at around seven in the evening.
[00:02:08.080] - Speaker 1
And once they brought her back, they took her to Gilardo. Well, she was left just as he said, and she has an allergy to it. She was left with something, like a scab that they threw away, but she didn't die. Now, this Chinese guy who died from the snake a few days ago, remember? But they say I don't know what happened to that man, but he stopped to die. That one was really going to die. Yes or no? But that house was big, the snake.
[00:02:35.740] - Speaker 2
And have any of your animals been killed by a snake, such as livestock, a pet, or a chicken? No, none of mine. No.
[00:02:44.500] - Speaker 1
No, nothing. Not so far.
[00:02:48.890] - Speaker 2
Do you know how to prevent or avoid a snake bite?
[00:02:54.200] - Speaker 1
As far as I know, one person keeps an eye on them, because I used to find them on the farm and I didn't kill them. I feel sorry for animals. To be honest, I don't even kill a chicken. If I'm riding my motorcycle and I see a worm crawling across the road, I stop the bike so the worm can cross without getting run over, because I feel sorry for killing it, because it's a life. And the world is ending because of the lack of those animals, yes or no? Yes. Because those animals always have a It's like a car, when you take something away from it, the car starts to... And the world is practically ending because of the lack of those animals, because they put so much poison and all that stuff on the animals and they're dying, and those are the ones that produce the... At least some of them for the earth. That's why you can't grow anything anymore because nothing grows, because it doesn't grow because of that, because of the lack of those animals.
[00:03:35.978] - Speaker 1
Bees, all of that is necessary. They're something that's part of life.
[00:03:42.220] - Speaker 2
And what would you do if a snake died?
[00:03:46.130] - Speaker 1
If a snake dies on me, I'm going straight to the hospital, because I'm really scared of them.
[00:03:52.820] - Speaker 2
Would you go to the hospital in Carmen or somewhere else?
[00:03:55.950] - Speaker 1
Well, in Carmen they just throw you out so they can move on, they don't treat you there. It's just a hospital for passing through. Okay, yes. Yes, they give you some aspirin and you go there once, because they don't have anything there. They say that when they treat you or when you go to Tolemaida, they say, I don't know if it's true or not.
[00:04:14.600] - Speaker 2
And if you need to go to the hospital, is it difficult for you or is it easy from here?
[00:04:19.930] - Speaker 1
If you go to the hospital, no, easy. Well, 10 minutes, you spend one. Okay, fine. Yes, that's quick.
[00:04:25.710] - Speaker 2
And where do you feel most likely to be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:04:33.860] - Speaker 1
Well, then, give them a chance, because I've even caught them here and thrown them over there, into the pasture, because they've come here. They're tiny, but they come. But I don't kill them, because I don't like killing them, so I throw them over there, like spiders. Some big ones come from science, and they're more dangerous, more trouble, because they're dangerous. No, that's not a fish. Because you're going to kill it, unless you're invading their territory, taking away their space, because this is their forest. So, I don't kill them, I catch them and throw them over there.
[00:05:02.200] - Speaker 2
Yes. And do you know how to identify poisonous snakes or venomous snakes?
[00:05:08.200] - Speaker 1
Well, sometimes I know them, but sometimes I don't. Yes. Because sometimes they're very similar to the spicy ones. Yes, it's difficult.
[00:05:15.850] - Speaker 2
And how do you identify snakes? By their color? By their color.
[00:05:20.500] - Speaker 1
Because of their color and stripes. Because they always have a mark, the poisonous ones are more distinctive than the others.
[00:05:25.720] - Speaker 2
Yes, okay.
[00:05:29.300] - Speaker 1
You learn a lot about that stuff in the countryside, I mean, you get to know them.
[00:05:34.880] - Speaker 2
And do you know of any other cases of snake bites? Because you mentioned your mother-in-law.
[00:05:42.220] - Speaker 1
No, my son's mother-in-law. Your daughter's.
[00:05:44.760] - Speaker 2
And you don't know of any other cases?
[00:05:46.690] - Speaker 1
And the lady I told you about who used to live here, but I don't know much else about her. And the other man who died, it seems like it was a long time ago. The one today, the son of this man, Sorrentino. But cases closer to home, people we know, no.
[00:06:02.130] - Speaker 2
Well, I don't have any more questions, but do you have anything else to say about snakes, your knowledge of snakes, anything else?
[00:06:12.000] - Speaker 1
No, not like that.
[00:06:14.260] - Speaker 2
Right? Okay. And I think, you know, but it's important to know that after a snake bite, you should go straight to the hospital. Sure. And it's important to know what kind of snake it was. Yes, it died.
[00:06:30.680] - Speaker 1
Supposedly, it's your turn to take her, isn't it?
[00:06:32.510] - Speaker 2
Yes, you can kill her and take her away, you can take a photo.
[00:06:35.730] - Speaker 1
Yes, but you have to take her there, because the other day when the late María died, they didn't take that animal, and then they had a problem because of that. But in the end, they took care of her, but they took care of her very late. So she didn't get treated in time. Things like that are like an illness, because you feel pain here and you say, "No, I'll drink some of this and that will take the pain away." And no, a lot of times you don't go to the doctor because you're afraid of the doctor, that you're sick, that you're not. You don't go to the doctor because they send you for tests, and then you find out what disease you have and all that stuff, because a lot of times people die because they don't know what they have. And so, it's the same with the snake. If you don't take care of it, you have to move right away or something bad will happen.
[00:07:29.010] - Speaker 2
Well, that's all I have. Thank you very much for your time, you're very kind. No, thank you. I'm glad, thank you.
