[00:00:26.560] - Speaker 1
And how many years have you lived here, in Carmen?
[00:00:28.810] - Speaker 2
I've been here for 13 years. Well, do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here? Well, you never know, you could be walking along and get bitten by one of those things. I almost got bitten by one the other day.
[00:00:45.390] - Speaker 1
Has any of your animals been bitten by a snake, such as a pet, livestock, or a chicken?
[00:00:56.360] - Speaker 2
No, the dog did kill one, but he wasn't bitten. What he did was kill her and then he got angry and hurt himself when the snake bit him, so he killed it. The little dog got screwed.
[00:01:09.740] - Speaker 1
And do you know how they prevented a snake bite?
[00:01:15.540] - Speaker 2
I don't know.
[00:01:19.160] - Speaker 1
And what would you do if a snake bit you?
[00:01:22.520] - Speaker 2
Firstly, going to the hospital, because where else can we go?
[00:01:26.180] - Speaker 1
Yes, of course. Would you go to the hospital in Carmen or somewhere else?
[00:01:31.030] - Speaker 2
No, I'm going to go to Giradot, because they don't have any in Carmen Or Melgar, Giradot.
[00:01:37.440] - Speaker 1
And if you need to go to the hospital, is it difficult for you or is it easy from here?
[00:01:46.330] - Speaker 2
If there's no transportation, it's difficult. Of course.
[00:01:49.620] - Speaker 1
And you don't always have transportation.
[00:01:52.270] - Speaker 2
There isn't always someone to move him, I don't know why, I don't see it. We're not both there, he can't walk on his own.
[00:01:58.310] - Speaker 1
Yes, okay. And where do you feel most likely to be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:02:07.130] - Speaker 2
In the countryside or in the mountains, because at home
[00:02:11.090] - Speaker 1
And why is it more likely in the mountains?
[00:02:14.980] - Speaker 2
Because you always go out walking or traveling here and there, it could be anywhere. But here, at home, no.
[00:02:26.290] - Speaker 1
And do you know how to identify poisonous snakes, or do you not know?
[00:02:31.770] - Speaker 2
No, he doesn't know what talla Xs are, what coral they are, what different types of colors there are, but no. He doesn't know how to identify which one was more poisonous.
[00:02:42.540] - Speaker 1
Yes, of course. And when you identify the snakes, how do you tell them apart? By their color? By their color.
[00:02:50.110] - Speaker 2
Because of the color.
[00:02:51.190] - Speaker 1
Okay. And do you know of any cases of snake bites?
[00:02:58.530] - Speaker 2
Not around here. There have been some over there, up above, who say they've been bitten, but like Jesús, Cardona, who was bitten on the head by a talla. I don't know what, like a year ago it bit him.
[00:03:14.800] - Speaker 1
In your head?
[00:03:16.210] - Speaker 2
Yes, I was washing the cars and walked under the roof.
[00:03:21.530] - Speaker 1
I heard about that case. Did he go to the hospital?
[00:03:27.290] - Speaker 2
Yes, I think they took it straight there.
[00:03:29.160] - Speaker 1
And He is. And, well, I don't have any more questions, but do you have anything else to say about snakes or your knowledge of snakes or anything else? No, ma'am. Okay. And it's important to know that after a snake bite, go straight to the hospital, and it's important to know what kind of snake bit you, because there are different antivenoms for different snakes, and you can take a picture or you can kill it and take it to the hospital. And that's the most important thing to know. But thank you very much. I don't have any more questions. Very kind. All right.
