[00:00:29.510] - Speaker 1
And why? I practically grew up here. When we went to Bogotá, I was 28, and then I came back again. I've been here for four years. Let's say four years. Okay. And it could happen. The pandemic, we came here.
[00:00:44.090] - Speaker 2
So, do you think it's likely that you'll get bitten by a snake here?
[00:00:48.900] - Speaker 1
Sure.
[00:00:49.720] - Speaker 2
Why?
[00:00:50.420] - Speaker 1
Because here there is.
[00:00:52.970] - Speaker 2
Sure, yes.
[00:00:54.660] - Speaker 1
They must have arrived here. They're tiny, but they've arrived.
[00:00:58.360] - Speaker 2
And have any of your animals been bitten by a snake, such as a pet, livestock, or a rooster? What?
[00:01:04.530] - Speaker 1
About us?
[00:01:06.570] - Speaker 2
Yes, you. No. No? Okay, well. And do you know how to prevent or avoid a snake bite?
[00:01:16.560] - Speaker 1
Run away.
[00:01:18.330] - Speaker 2
Yes, of course. Of course. And, well, what would you do if a snake bit you?
[00:01:26.510] - Speaker 1
I think the panic you give them gives them a heart attack. I don't want them to cut a rope, I don't want to have a heart attack, because I imagine, who isn't afraid of ropes? Not me, I'm very afraid of ropes. Of course. A rope is something that is
[00:01:39.380] - Speaker 2
No, it's kind of scary.
[00:01:40.750] - Speaker 1
And I say that I can think to myself I can think that, what if I've bitten the bullet just this once. The impact hit me so hard, I think it was like a heart attack. Because one says to the other, because one said to the other: Why did you stay?
[00:01:52.920] - Speaker 2
I understand, yes, I understand. Would you go to the hospital?
[00:01:59.270] - Speaker 1
Of course, if you have time to go, then of course you should go.
[00:02:04.280] - Speaker 2
Would you go to the hospital in Carmen or somewhere else? Yes, that's the fastest one. And would you trust the hospital in Carmen to cure a heartbreak?
[00:02:12.380] - Speaker 1
No, seeing where he ended up, that's terrible. And they have him over there? I don't know. Do they have to keep him there? How many are there? Yes, the closest place. Yes, of course.
[00:02:20.440] - Speaker 2
That they can send you somewhere else from there, I don't know.
[00:02:24.480] - Speaker 1
Okay, yes.
[00:02:25.100] - Speaker 2
You have to keep an eye on that, right? Yes, sometimes. But Mostly, no. Yes. And if you need to go to the hospital, is it difficult for you or is it easy from here? No, but if you ask someone here, it's easy. You say, get on the motorcycle and go, but what if you don't make it because you're scared, or they won't let you ride with them, or someone else takes you.
[00:02:47.490] - Speaker 1
But, for example, if you're out there alone And you can't walk or something. Or if you're holding something in your hand, how are you going to drive? Yes, of course. Yes, you have to take each situation as it comes, because instead of having a small farm out there, I maintain it from here. Instead of when I have work in construction, I go out there to plant crops, to work. In fact, I've come across them. So, fear makes you think that if you bite one of those animals and you're alone, or if you come across one, because someone else is guiding you, you can get them out, right? They help you, but if you're alone... Who knows what the bat was like?
[00:03:25.900] - Speaker 2
And where do you feel it is more likely to happen? And is it more likely that you will be bitten by a snake? In the countryside or at home?
[00:03:34.290] - Speaker 1
No, in the countryside. Yes, up north, over there.
[00:03:38.900] - Speaker 2
And can you identify six poisonous or venomous snakes?
[00:03:42.050] - Speaker 1
Well, the one I already showed you, yes, your parents, older people always know, at least that it's size X, that it's tough, that it's that purigora, I can more or less tell that one apart, that coral one. But I know the coral one with another one that's similar. What's it like? The tail there, once Yes, the tail there. They're two different ones, right? It's not just one, they're two different ones.
[00:04:09.010] - Speaker 2
A corral, a tail from there is a coral. That one. And there are also other corals. Corals.
[00:04:15.730] - Speaker 1
I'm eating those two. Yes. I'm eating those two. Yes. They're like the ones they call toche, the ones they keep so they don't use the branches, the ones that lower the branches. Then they say those are more poisonous, but they say they're not. The people who came here passed them on, didn't they? No. Because I was really scared of the bugs, but now that I know they're not dangerous, I don't worry so much But I'm still scared of snakes, of course, you wouldn't go near one.
[00:04:42.000] - Speaker 2
Yes. And when you identify snakes, do you identify them by their color, their skin, or their head?
[00:04:50.760] - Speaker 1
Yes, by the color of its skin, I can identify one or two that are that type of snake, which is fierce and commands respect.
[00:05:00.430] - Speaker 2
And do you know of a case of a snake with brown fur?
[00:05:05.270] - Speaker 1
No, that's what they told me, like what happened to the late Ricardo, sometimes a cobierna killed you over there, that one was killed by a cuadra over there, that one really died, the late Ricardo, Cartoso was his name, Cartoso, right? Cartoso. Many years ago, where Ramón was, he was killed by a cow. And now the one who stabbed Arandela up there, the boy we call Arandela. They took him quickly to the village, to the espinal, they threw him to Ibaquien and he didn't die, but he was also struck by cholera. No, I don't know, to Mortiño, that son of Flor, he's right there, he was struck by cholera. And María, Novillo's wife, she's very strong. Yes.
[00:05:48.320] - Speaker 2
I don't have any more questions, but do you have anything else to say about snakes or your knowledge of snakes or anything like that?
[00:05:57.040] - Speaker 1
No, knowledge, yes, no, because I, even I, I've been with people who have caught them, who catch them. And I say: No, I wouldn't catch them even if they were dead. No, I don't dare. And once, I think he caught it badly. He picked up a curera, put it in a box like this and grabbed it by the head, and I said, "No, I don't do that. What if it didn't grab you by the head and bit you? No, I didn't have any.
[00:06:27.840] - Speaker 2
And well, the most important thing to know is that after a snake bite, you need to go straight to the hospital. And it's important to know what kind of snake bit you, because there are different Sure, so you can tell them there. Yes, exactly. Yes, it's very important. Yes, it's very important. You can take a picture of the snake or you can... To wash it... Exactly. Yes. Colors. Yes, yes, yes, exactly. One more thing. Yes. And that's the most important thing to know. Well, thank you very much for your time, very kind of you.
[00:07:04.120] - Speaker 1
But don't go saying, "What's up with her?" If you do something, don't go saying No, the solution is... It's to run and look for it.
[00:07:13.220] - Speaker 2
It's the only one. They're going to put one in the shopping cart.
[00:07:16.860] - Speaker 1
Yes, and see how you get the evidence or the screenshot. Or take a photo or record it properly or take it with you. Or take it with you, yes. Or also, if possible, well
[00:07:26.530] - Speaker 2
Yes, exactly.
[00:07:27.070] - Speaker 1
I saw myself Look, now that it's been like... That was this year, at the beginning of the year. I have a corn mill there, and I went to clean an avocado tree. I went to clean a calabash, it was stuck, I went to clean a calabash, I cleaned one and moved on to the next one, cleaning it, cleaning it when there's a ravine like that. And there's a palm tree there, the one called hiraca, it was like that. And then I said: To get down there, that's why I threw it away and I'm kind of afraid of the curras. It was all clean there, in the bush, it had been dragged down, you could see the clean fox, the little ravine must have been clean. And I said: No, to get down there, I can get down here. I'll hold on to this leaf, I took the leaf and did this, a palm leaf from the palm tree and I did this. Like this, with this hand, I made a machete here.
[00:08:11.764] - Speaker 1
And of course, I took what I made and did this. Yes, but it didn't come out. And it was hard, so I said: I'll grab it and slide down, because it's pretty hollow. Why? It was to go to the other side, to clean another stick, to get you down because you were on the other side.
[00:08:28.090] - Speaker 1 (class 1, class 2, )
So, when I was standing there like this, I did this, and it went thud. Then I went to put the machete away, I let go of the blade and went to put the machete away. I grabbed the handle here and went to put the machete away. When I saw it like this, man, it was like this, with a tongue here. Micho was about 30 centimeters from my leg. Brother, I have a shellfish behind me that I'm going to give myself a hole. That and it was No, my mother. It's a stalk, right? That one really scared me. Micho, it's just that where I moved forward a little, where I was lucky, when I don't put the comb in, I hang the blade and when I hang the blade, I go down and put my hands on it. And she was already awake, she was ready for them to see me doing that. That one really scared me. And it was like five in the afternoon and I said, "Holy Christ.
[00:09:18.033] - Speaker 1
" In fact, I cleaned those avocados. Yesterday I went down there and cleaned them because I hadn't been back.
[00:09:25.810] - Speaker 2
How scary.
[00:09:26.750] - Speaker 1
Of course, it wasn't a fear. The only animals he mentioned were ones that scared him a lot when he had them at a meal. And that really scares me.
[00:09:33.700] - Speaker 2
Yes, of course. Well, thank you. Thank you very much for your time.
