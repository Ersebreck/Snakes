    "analysis": "This interview provides insights into a rural Colombian resident's perspectives and experiences related to snake bites. Key themes include:\n\n1. Awareness of snake bite risks in both rural areas and homes, with personal anecdotes of close encounters.\n2. Knowledge of initial first-aid steps like tourniquets and remedies, but also the importance of seeking hospital treatment.\n3. Trust in local hospitals for snake bite treatment, but acknowledgment that larger cities may have better resources.\n4. Difficulty distinguishing venomous from non-venomous snakes, with the perspective that all snakes can be dangerous.\n5. Familiarity with cases of snake bites to humans and livestock in the community.\n\nThe overall perspective seems to be one of caution and respect for the threat snakes pose, coupled with practical knowledge about bite response from living in a rural snake-prone area. The resident advocates a combined approach of first-aid and prompt medical treatment for effective bite management.",
