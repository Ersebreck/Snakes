    "analysis": "Based on the interview, here are the key insights:\n\n1. Key themes: Perceived snakebite risk, treatment knowledge, healthcare system trust, snake identification, and snakebite experiences.\n\n2. Notable patterns: The speaker expresses a high perceived risk of snakebite due to working on the farm and encountering snakes around the home. They demonstrate accurate knowledge of seeking hospital treatment for snakebites but mistrust the local hospital's capabilities. The speaker can accurately identify venomous snake species based on physical characteristics.\n\n3. Overall speaker perspective: The speaker has firsthand experience with snakebites, having witnessed a neighbor suffer a severe bite. They are aware of the risks associated with their rural environment and the importance of proper snakebite treatment, although they lack confidence in the local healthcare system's ability to handle such cases effectively.\n\nIn summary, the interview highlights the speaker's lived experiences with snakes, their risk perception, treatment-seeking intentions, and the challenges they perceive in accessing adequate snakebite care in their community.",
